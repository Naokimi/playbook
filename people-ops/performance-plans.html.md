  Sometimes, a team member's performance drops so much it requires to be corrected. When this
  happens, a performance plan can help them get back on track.

Part of your mentor's responsibilities is to provide feedback continuously, so that you have the
ability to correct any shortcomings as soon as they are noticed. We want everyone to always be
in the loop about their performance in the company.

With that said, there might be situations where an employee's performance drops to a level that
requires a formal process to be corrected. Should you ever find yourself in that position, we want
you to be clear on where you stand and what our process looks like.

## Step 1: Initiate

A performance plan can be initiated by your mentor, who will inform you and schedule a call to
discuss what is going wrong. You will be able to share your input and thoughts, as well as any ideas
on how your mentor can help you get back on track.

The output of this call will be:

* a list of goals your mentor expects you to achieve;
* the expected timeline to achieve those goals;
* how you expect to achieve those goals.

Your mentor will also start a shared Google Doc where they will record all the details about the
performance plan. This document may be shared with other mentors as needed.

## Step 2: Monitor

After the performance plan is initiated, your mentor will provide ample support and monitor you
closely to ensure you achieve the agreed goals in the established timeline.

Your mentor is there to help you get your performance to an acceptable level, so make sure to
provide them with any information they might need to help you get back on track.

Your mentor will also provide continuous feedback on your performance throughout this period, so you
know if you're heading in the right direction.

## Step 3: Triage

At the established date, you will touch base with your mentor again.

If your performance is now at an acceptable level, this will be the end of the performance plan.
Your mentor will record this in the Google Doc and everything will be back to normal.

If you're still not where you need to be, then that might be a sign there is a higher-level problem
with your role at Nebulab. At this point, your mentor will take a step back and have a more detailed
discussion to figure out whether Nebulab and your current role at Nebulab is a good fit for you and
how you can prove that.

The output of this second conversation is a new plan to get back on track, with new goals and a new
timeline.

## Step 4: Monitor

See step 2.

## Step 5: Conclude

This is the last step of the performance plan.

If your performance is now acceptable, this is the end of the process. The Google Doc will be
updated to reflect your progress and you will discuss how you and your mentor can prevent future
slip-ups.

If your performance is still not satisfactory, then this is almost certainly a sign Nebulab is not
the right company for you. A failed performance plan will result in termination.
