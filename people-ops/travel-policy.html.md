title: Travel policy
meta_description: >
  Coordinating travel for a distributed team is not easy, but it becomes less of a struggle with a
  good Travel Policy in place. Here's what we use at Nebulab.
---

This travel policy defines travel and conference attendance guidelines for 2020.

## Communication

The #travel Slack channel should be used for all travel-related requests such as hotel bookings, 
flight tickets and so on. 

## Travel

Regardless of how much time you spend traveling, we consider travel days (Mon-Fri) as full 8-hour
workdays. Travel during the weekend (Sat-Sun) is not considered work time, but we always try to book
trips during the workweek.

We choose comfortable seats and arrangements to allow people to work during the journey and make up
for the lost time, but working is not mandatory since not everyone is comfortable working while on
the move.

If you miss your because of reasons not caused by Nebulab or the carrier, you will have to reach the
destination at your expense, if possible.

### Trains

We'll reserve first-class seats at the time preferred by the team member, if possible. There might
be fluctuations of 1 hour from the scheduled time.

### Flights

Flight seat categories are the following:

- Italy/Europe: Economy
- Worldwide: Economy with comfort seat (when possible, for flights over 6 hours)

Considering the frequency of our trips abroad, we advise obtaining a passport as soon as you enter
the company, as release times can vary wildly depending on the time of the year.

Make sure to check-in online 24-48 hours in advance and print your boarding pass before departure.

### Car

We prefer to travel by public transport, but if you have to travel by car, the following policies 
apply:

- if you use your vehicle between the main offices (Pescara/Latina - Latina/Pescara) there's a
  flat-rate reimbursement of €150.00 per round-trip;
- if you use your car in Italy, we'll refer to the ViaMichelin cost estimation;
- total reimbursement for group B rental cars, including fuel and highway fees.

### Uber

Use Uber if you need a quick, easy ride around the city.

Before your departure, check if Uber is available at your destination (you can do it from
[here](https://www.uber.com/it/cities/)). Also make sure you're part of the Nebulab Uber
organization (if you're not, ask for it in the #travel Slack channel).

All you have to do if you need a ride is book your Uber as usual and select "Nebulab Srls" from the
account selection menu.

## Accommodation

Where possible, we'll prefer rooms with two single beds or two queen beds.

| City size    | Country   | Budget (per night per room) | Examples                                      |
|--------------|-----------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Medium/Small | Italy     | 70€                         | Pescara, Latina                               |
| Large        | Italy     | 120€                        | Rome, Milan, Florence, Bologna, Turin         |
| Large        | Europe    | 150€                        | London, Paris, Berlin                         |
| Large        | Worldwide | 200€                        | New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Toronto |

## Reimbursements

To obtain reimbursement, you'll have to use your American Express corporate credit card.
Transactions made through the company credit card don't require an expense report. For all expenses
where the company credit card cannot be used, or if you refused to have a corporate credit card,
you'll have to submit an expense report, attaching your receipts (for both meals and travel) within
seven days of your return.

You can also download the “Dipendenti in Cloud” native mobile application to enter expenses from
your phone.

### Reimbursement for travel in Italy

We offer full reimbursement for the following expenses: train tickets, flight tickets, car rentals,
bus tickets, hotel stay with breakfast and event ticket. Meals are on the team member. Moreover, we
offer full reimbursement for Taxi/Bus rides from/to the train station, bus station or airport
to/from the hotel and for the journey hotel/venue/hotel.

### Reimbursement for international travel

We offer full reimbursement for the following expenses: train tickets, flight tickets, car rentals,
bus tickets, travel insurance, hotel stays, event ticket and a daily refund of up to €60,00/day for
meals including tips. This daily allowance is cumulative for all days spent abroad. Alcoholic and
soft drinks are included with meals but must not exceed €15 per day.

We also fully reimburse any [Uber](#uber), cab or public transport rides from/to your train station,
bus station, airport, hotel or venue.

We do not reimburse hotel minibar consumptions, pay-per-view TV, or any fines for traffic
violations.

We provide adequate medical insurance for any trips outside the EU.

## Team retreats

We will organize one team retreat per year. Team retreats usually last one week and give us a chance
to get to know each other better, build trust and improve communication and cooperation.

They're also a lot of fun!

We'll inform everyone of team retreats at least three months in advance. Attendance is not 
mandatory, but strongly encouraged.

## Useful apps

- **Wi-Fi Finder** detects free Wi-fi networks.
- **MetrO, Kinevia** is a free mobile guide to public transport systems worldwide. It provides the
fastest route to your point of interest considering the day of the week and the time of the day.

Wallet or Pass2U Wallet. Also, it will provide handy information about your flight.

## Travel tips

- Always watch your passport's expiration date. Make sure it expires in at least 6 months.
- Also ensure you always have at least two blank pages for visas in your passport.  
- If you are traveling to the US or plan on renting a car/staying in a hotel, you will need a credit
  card. If you don't have one, get one from your bank or use the American Express corporate credit
  card.
- You can find useful information for the country you are visiting, such as any practices needed to
  enter the country (visa, vaccinations etc), on the [Farnesina](http://www.viaggiaresicuri.it/home.html)
  website.
