  We set up a hiring pipeline that allows us to consistently hire the right people for our team. In
  our Playbook, we share our process and more tips!
---

We are always looking for people who share our values, the desire to work in a team and the passion
to face new challenges every day.

For Nebulab, hiring means contributing to the success of our mission by increasing our capacity to:

- satisfy our clients in terms of work volume and quality;
- attract new developers;
- create high-quality software;
- produce content that contributes to our personal growth and the growth of Nebulab as a company.

On the other hand, each time we hire, we commit to making our new teammate grow in an environment
that contributes to their personal and professional success, making them happy and fulfilled.

We have a responsibility towards all those involved in this project to create a cohesive and
functional team, so we put a lot of effort into selecting new members of the team. This is why we
created a hiring process that must be adhered to as closely as possible, in order to avoid bias and
subjective choices.

## Hiring process

Usually the whole hiring process takes one month, but it could take longer depending on the number
of candidates in our pipeline and other commitments of the team working on your assessment.

Hiring at Nebulab is a 5-step process:

1. [application](#application)
2. [aptitude questionnaire](#aptitude-questionnaire)
3. [informal chat](#informal-chat)
4. [technical assessment](#technical-assessment)
5. [offer](#offer)

### Application

Hi!

This first contact gives us an idea if there is a cultural and technical fit that will allow us
to start to get to know each other. Usually, we find candidates in one of the following ways:

- by referral (for example, your former colleague who now works for us);
- from GitHub, LinkedIn or Stack Overflow searches;
- from the form on our [Careers](https://nebulab.it/careers/) page.

If you are applying for a job, complete the form providing some information about yourself, your
experience with software development and with [the tools we use](https://nebulab.it/tools/), your
approach to work and why you are interested in Nebulab.

Someone from our team will read your letter and, if they think you might be a good candidate, they
will send you a link to the [aptitude questionnaire](#aptitude-questionnaire) which is the first
step in the hiring process.

### Aptitude questionnaire

The aptitude questionnaire is a way for us to get to know you better and to understand how you think,
act and communicate. The test will be mainly focused on your soft skills but there are some basic
technical questions as well. The questionnaire will be sent to you as a Google form, which you can
complete at your own pace. The only thing we ask is that you tell us when we can expect your answers,
so we can do a better job of coordinating our hiring efforts.

The fundamental requirement in answering the questionnaire is sincerity: write in accordance with
your values and the way you work, not what you think we would like to hear from you. The purpose of
the questionnaire is to understand whether you're a good cultural and technical fit, so it is in
everyone's interest that the answers reflect the way you really work and handle problems.

Don't hesitate to ask clarifications on questions or technical issues in case anything is not clear
to you, and don't be afraid to hit a wrong note: in the past, some of the most striking answers
were completely out of tune, perhaps mentioning aspects outside of the work context, but they
allowed us to perfectly understand the person on the other end of the screen.

### Informal chat

This is a video call where we will explain the Nebulab values, our needs and the way we work. We
will also ask you to explain what are you looking for in your ideal work environment and why you
think that Nebulab would be a good choice.

This chat should help us understand whether we would like to work together and meet daily in a work
context.

In this phase there are no specific questions: we avoid formalities, we talk about a bit of
everything and see how we feel about each other. We will also discuss some of the answers you gave
in the [aptitude questionnaire](#aptitude-questionnaire).

Some advice for the chat:

* **Be on time.** This is extremely important and is an indicator of your professionalism: just
  being on time will give you an advantage on many candidates.
* **Be equipped.** Make sure you have a good Internet connection, a good headset and a good camera.
  And please, find a quiet place to call from!
* **Turn up prepared.** You already know that we will talk about Nebulab and about you, so prepare
  some questions about us and some answers about yourself!
* **Be yourself.** The get-to-know meeting is meant to help understand what type pf person you are
  and how you can fit in the company. We cannot do that if you pretend to be someone else.
* **Relax.** We are humans. None of us is an HR manager or has a psychology degree. Think, behave
  and talk as you would do normally.

### Technical assessment

If you have reached this stage, it means we think you may be a good candidate and that working with
you would be a pleasure. At this point, we want to get an idea of your technical skills.

You will not be asked to do any live coding or solve absurd challenges. Instead, we just want to
make sure that your technical skills are coherent with our expectations, so feel at ease: nobody
here manages to solve business problems without looking up documentation and/or Stack Overflow.

The technical assessment consists of a feature, enhancement or bugfix on to implement on an
open-source project, which will be selected according to your role and experience. You'll work at
your own pace and simply open a PR on the project when you're done. The PR will then be reviewed by
the hiring managers assigned to your application, who will almost certainly ask to adjust certain
aspects of it and explain the rationale behind your choices.

Here are some tips to help you excel:

- Pay attention to documentation and Git history.
- Follow the conventions established on the project.
- If in doubt, feel free to ask! You have our full support.

### Offer

We will contact you to let you know to let you know what salary level we have in mind for you.
The offer often comes with a series of objectives, which we will agree upon with you based on your
level and the offer formulated.

Feel free to let us know if you disagree, and we will try to find some middle ground. We are ready
to adjust our offer if we have set objectives that are either too low or overly ambitious.

## Hiring manager guidelines

Each candidate is assigned two hiring managers, whose approval is required for the candidate to
proceed to the next step (i.e. either hiring manager can stop the process and reject the candidate
at any point).

With such a great responsibility on their shoulders, it is extremely important for hiring managers
to be aligned on the practices and principles of our hiring process.

### When to hire?

We only hire people when it hurts (<https://m.signalvnoise.com/hire-when-it-hurts/>). If you're not
going crazy because of all the different projects and initiatives you need to look after, it's
probably not the time to hire someone yet.

This is mainly because Nebulab is still a somewhat small company: every hire matters, both from a
cultural and a financial perspective. We need to make absolutely sure we can support each and every
one of our employees in the same way, so we'd rather pass on a good candidate if we don't feel
completely ready to onboard them yet.

One exception to this is that we try to always have a backend and a frontend developer who are not
assigned on a client project, but are ready to start on a new one when needed. This is because we
cannot ask clients to wait while we source developers for them.

### Conducting an interview

During the interview, one hiring manager is in charge of following the scorecard and asking the
relevant questions, while the other observes and listens to catch any particularly positive
answers/traits or red flags.

With that said, both hiring managers should be able to ask questions, so if you're conducting the
interview make sure to bring your colleague into the conversation at least two or three times to
make sure they can also talk to the candidate.

When following the scorecard, try to be as informal as possible so that the candidate is comfortable
and authentic, but keep the conversation on point if it goes off topic.

### The Golden Rule

If it's not a hell yes, it's a no.

We're a small company. Making a bad hire costs us far more, in terms of lost time, money and
opportunities, than not making an immediate hire.

In retrospect, every bad hire we have made in the past has raised some kind of red flag. Maybe we
were not sure the candidate was a good cultural fit, or we felt like they were only good at
executing tasks and not self-starters. Whatever the reason, we thought we could overlook or fix the
candidate's shortcomings, but this is almost never the case.

This doesn't mean we should only hire superstars: it's okay for someone to not be in the 1% from a
technical perspective. They will grow and learn over time. In fact, some of our best past hires were
junior or mid-level engineers that strongly resonated with our culture. It is NOT okay to accept a
candidate who is possibly not a good fit for the way we work.
