# Our values

All of us, in our work, have direct relations with colleagues and 
stakeholders, such as clients, other development teams, members of the OSS community or other 
professionals. The relationship established with them is fundamental: we must always keep in mind 
all the values and standards that Nebulab aims to represent and uphold.

Working at Nebulab means investing in an all-round collaboration context. It is essential 
to support one another as well as coordinate with each other in an attempt to compensate any possible shortcomings of other members of the team.

All that we want to be is described on our Internet site. Anyone contacting us 
expects to deal with people:

- Passionate about web technology;
- Expert in their field, but open to change;
- Developing high-quality products;
- Solving problems without getting lost in irrelevant details;
- Being nerds, but communicative;
- With whom you can work and have fun;
- Who experiment and share.

These expectations are reflected in our values, which are reported below together with some
exemplary behavioral aspects.

## Honesty

- We work honestly.
- We act and communicate in a sincere, loyal and transparent way.
- We are no looking for convenient solutions.
- We express our perplexities if we think that a given choice may 
  damage the project, even indirectly, on which we are working.
- We record and bill only for the hours actually worked on the project.

## Communication

- We say hi via the project communication channel at the beginning and at the end of the day.
- We always communicate clearly, simply and precisely.
- We use humor when appropriate.
- We provide all the information that can be useful to the client or other members of the 
  team, even simply what we are doing or will do today.
- We report doubts and problems.
- We keep out project management tools and client's tools updated.
- We promptly record the hours worked.
- We communicate in a timely fashion, delegating or postponing when we cannot
  provide a response immediately.

## Collaboration

- We help others to grow and put them in the position to help others in turn.
- We understand that productivity depends on our team's talent and the capacity to collaborate
  and we constantly try to improve both aspects.
- We do not solve problems alone, even if we were capable of doing so.
- We are patient when teaching others and we try to adapt to their learning style 
  instead of adapting them to our learning style.
- We operate with high standards and politely expect others to do the same.

## Problem owning

- We pay the necessary attention to problems, finding a compromise between technical perfection and
  the value that our solution brings to the project.
- With regard to our clients, we always act as if we are spending our money, not theirs.
- We ensure that the problems we are facing are not recurring.
- We are pragmatic and focus on details instead of high-level technicalities.
- We take a critical approach to problems, finding and suggesting the best solution.

## Growth

- We face challenges instead of avoiding them.
- We treat criticism as an opportunity to grow.
- We are inspired by the success of others and try to imitate them.
- We cultivate those aspects we would like to improve in ourselves.
- We treat our defects as improvement objectives instead of hiding them.
