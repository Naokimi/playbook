# Resignation

The employment contract provides the worker with the option of withdrawing unilaterally from the
contract by submitting his/her resignation. The [resignation procedure](https://www.cliclavoro.gov.it/Cittadini/Pagine/Adempimenti.aspx)
is  remote and can be sent in various ways:

- Autonomously, on the clicklavoro.gov.it sites for all those who have INPS access credentials.
  Below is a link to a useful [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/02yuLr7-h_E);
- By going to authorized entities, such as patronages, trade union organizations, certification
  commissions, bilateral entities, and, with the introduction of Legislative Decree 185/2016, also 
  labor consultants and territorial offices at the National Labor Inspectorate ("Ispettorato
  Nazionale del Lavoro").

The resignation must be given with sufficient advance notice, variable depending on contract type,
seniority and level. It is usually 20-30 days, but please check your individual case.
