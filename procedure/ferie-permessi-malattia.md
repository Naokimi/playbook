# Vacations, time off, special leave and sick leave

The working day for full-time contracts is 8 hours. It can be decided contractually to
reduce the working hours using so-called part-time work.

Vacation and residual leave hours can be viewed in your payroll slip:

* Vacation days, in the box `FERIE RES.`
* Abolished holiday hours (or former Public Holidays), in the box `FEST. RES.`
* Work time Reduction Hours (or ROL), in the box `ROL RES.`

The same applies to the quantities earned and used, displayed in the same box corresponding to 
`MAT.` and `GOD.`. The acronym `A.P.` stands for Previous Year and indicates the amounts corresponding to
the previous year, but which can still be taken.

## Vacations

There are 22 days of vacation per year (176 hours). All members of the team must communicate via chat or 
verbally, possibly at least two weeks in advance, the vacations days they wish
to take.

## Time off, special leave and overtime

The annual number hours for time off varies depending on your seniority.

| Seniority in months     | Hours/Year |
|-----------------------|----------|
| 0 - 24                |    32    |
| 25 - 48               |    60    |
| >48                   |    88    |

Another type of paid leave is when it is granted in special cases.
Below is a non-exhaustive list:

- Birth;
- Marriage;
- Death of relatives up to those once removed;
- blood donation.

If you think you have the right to paid leave, write to the administrative manager, who will
check this for you.

Overtime is a working time in excess of the 8 hours a day. By law it is not allowed, 
under any circumstances, to exceed the limit of 48 hours a week.

### Compensation and rounding-off

All overtime hours and time off in the month will be compensated at the end of the month. The
balance will then be rounded-up to the nearest half-hour by applying the following rules:

- from 0 to 0.249 = 0;
- from 0.25 to 0.749 = 0.5;
- from 0.75 to 1 = 1

and so on.

## Illness

For communications regarding illness, employees must contact their
physician to request a sick leave certificate. The physician will
send the certificate electronically to INPS, which, in turn, will make it available in
electronic form. Based on the sick leave days granted by the attending physician, the employee must 
communicate to the company the days of absence together with the certificate's unique code.

# Choice of type

The choice of type of supporting document to provide must follow these criteria:

- `Time-off / Vacation` is used for time-off hours or vacation days: therefore, 
  you can use it for the whole days off or by putting in the number of hours of time-off; 
- `Sick-leave` is used in case of Illness, **inserting the Protocol Code in the notes
  issued by the attending physician**;
- `Special leave` is used for time off granted in special cases listed in the 
  section [Time-off, special permits and overtime](https://github.com/nebulab/playbook/blob/master/procedure/ferie-permessi-malattia.md#permessi-permessi-straordinari-e-lavoro-straordinario).
