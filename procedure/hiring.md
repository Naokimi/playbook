# Hiring

We are always looking for people who share our values, the desire to work in a team 
and the passion to face new challenges every day.

For Nebulab, hiring means, on one hand, contributing to the success of our mission,
by increasing our capacity to:

- Satisfy the clients in terms of volume and work quality; 
- Attract new developers;
- Create high-quality software;
- Produce content that contributes to our personal growth and the growth of Nebulab
  as a company.

On the other hand, each time we hire, we commit to making the individual grow in an environment that
contributes to their personal and professional success, making them happy and fulfilled.

We have a responsibility towards all those involved in this project to create a
cohesive and functional team, so we try to put all our efforts into selecting new
members of the team. This is why we created a hiring process that must be adhered to as closely as
possible, in order to avoid bias and subjective choices.

## Selection phases

### Initial contact

Hi! 

This first contact gives us an idea if there is a cultural and technical fit that will allow us 
to start getting know each other. Usually, we find candidates in one of the following ways:

- By referral (for example, your former colleague who now works for us);
- From GitHub, LinkedIn or Stack Overflow searches;
- From the form on our page [Careers](https://nebulab.it/careers/).

If you are putting yourself forward for a job, complete the form providing some information about yourself, your experience in
software development and with [the instruments we use](https://nebulab.it/tools/), your approach 
to work and why you are interested in Nebulab.

Someone from our team will read your letter, and if they think you might be a good candidate, they will 
write to you to find the best time for an [informal chat](#informal-chat).

### Informal chat

This is a telephone call or a video conference to explain to you the Nebulab values, our 
needs and how we work. In the same way, we will ask you to explain what are you looking for 
in your ideal work environment and why you think that Nebulab would be a good choice.

This chat should help answer the following question: would we like to work together 
and meet daily in the work context?

In this phase there are no specific questions: we avoid formalities, we talk about everything and 
try to understand how we feel.

Some advice for the chat:

* **Be on time.** This is extremely important and is an indicator of your professionalism: just by being on time 
  will make you score a lot of points in our opinion.
* **Be equipped.** Make sure you have a good Internet connection, a good headset and  
  a good webcam. And please, do not be in a bar, but find a quiet place!
* **Turn up prepared.** You already know that we will talk about Nebulab and about you, so prepare some 
  questions about us and some answers about yourself!
* **Be yourself.** The get-to-know meeting is meant to help understand what type pf person you are and 
  personalize your path. We cannot do that if you pretend to be someone else.
* **Relax.** We are humans. None of us is a human resources manager or  
  have a psychology degree. Think and talk as you would do normally.

### Attitude questionnaire

After the chat, we will send you an attitude questionnaire, which we will use to assess
how you work and your basic technical skills. The questionnaire will be sent to you as a 
Google document, which you can complete in your own time. The only thing we ask you is 
to tell us in advance when we can expect your answers, so we can coordinate 
the hiring efforts better.

The fundamental requirement in answering the questionnaire is sincerity: write 
in accordance with your values and the way you work, not what you think we would like to hear from you. The
purpose of the questionnaire is to understand if we think that there could be a good cultural and technical fit,
so it is in everyone's interest that the answers reflect as much as possible the way 
you really work and handle problems.

Don't hesitate to ask clarifications on questions or technical issues in case anything is
not clear to you, and don't be afraid to hit a wrong note: in the past, some of the most striking answers
were completely out of tune, perhaps mentioning aspects outside of the work
context, but permitted us to understand perfectly with whom 
we were dealing.

### Technical assessment

If we have reached this stage, it means that we think you may be a good candidate for 
our selection process. We are sure that working with you would be a pleasure, for us and for 
other members of the team. 

Usually this meeting takes place via a video call or in person, depending 
on how far you are from our offices. If we meet in person, please note that there is no dress-code to respect
and a t-shirt or a hoodie will not make you lose any points, given that 
we will probably wear one too!

The objective of this step is to understand your level in relation to other 
members of our team. Understanding this will help us formulate an offer corresponding to your abilities,
so if we haven't talked about this yet, feel free to tell us about your
possible economic expectations. This step will also help us to understand your attitudes and  
future potential.

Don't think of the technical interview as the classic interview where you are asked 
embarrassing questions on algorithms you know by heart or to program in front of us. Instead,  
we want to be sure that our ideas about you or that you communicated regarding your level  
of experience is coherent with our expectations, so feel at ease: nobody here manages 
to solve major problems without checking manuals, articles and Stack Overflow.

The technical assessment can assume various forms, whichever suits you best. These are
only some examples, but we are open to any idea, as long as it permits us to assess your 
technical level:

- We may discuss a project, open or closed-source, on which you worked recently.
  We will look at the sources together and we will ask you to explain the motivations and the background of the 
  project. Be prepared to discuss design and architectural choices, performance and possible
  future optimizations, development work flow, etc.
- We may work together on a small PR or an open source project of your choice, or 
  one chosen by us, if you don't have any ideas. We will be available at any time 
  to provide clarifications and help of any kind, so don't be afraid if you cannot remember
  something and need to ask or check a manual. Generally, we choose issues that
  do not require many lines of code, but a good amount of reflection to be tackled 
  correctly. Pay attention to the history of Git and the documentation!
- If you prefer, we can work on a problem of one of our clients (which will be selected in line with
  your technical level). You should also pay attention to the documentation and
  Git history in this case. Again, you will have the full support of the team for any clarification or help. If 
  you choose this option, we will pay for your work at the same rate we 
  would pay to an external consultant.

### Economic proposal

We will contact you to let you know to let you know the salary we would pay you once hired. 
The offer often comes with a series of objectives, which we will agree upon with you based on 
your level and the offer formulated.

Feel free to let us know if you disagree, and we will try to find some middle ground. 
We are ready to admit if we have set objectives for you that are either too low or overly ambitious.

## Times

Usually the whole hiring process takes one month, but it could take longer depending on the number of
candidates in our pipeline and other commitments of the team working on your 
assessment.
