# Workplace health and safety

Both of the Nebulab offices comply with current Italian workplace health and safety standards.

It is unproductive and certainly unhealthy to remain seated in the same position for almost eight hours. 
We strongly encourage all members of our team to take regular breaks of at least 15 
minutes every two hours of continuous work in front of a computer. During these breaks it's good to get up and 
walk away from your workstation and perform other activities, such as having coffee or  
tea, having a snack, taking a walk or walking a dog.

We recommend using [flexbot](http://www.flexbot.ai/), a slackbot that can help you 
practice these activities regularly.
