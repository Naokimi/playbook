# Profile photo

As you may have noted on Slack or GitHub, we all have similar profile photos. The profile photos 
are also used on our site in the Team section of the page [About Us](https://nebulab.it/about-us/). 
You will be included in the list once you have yours.

This is a picture of the set that we usually use to take the photos.

There is no need to create an exact reproduction of this set. It is only provided 
as an example. All we require is for your photo to be consistent with the others. Here is the result 
of the photo:

These assets must be given to Davide, who is in charge of post-production to finalize 
the photo:
