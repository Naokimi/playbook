Sometimes, your job as a mentor may become a bit lonely: you have people looking up to you to
continuously promote their growth and help them solve their problems, and it's not always clear
whether you're doing the right thing.

The goal of the Mentors roundtable is to solve exactly this kind of problem. It's a meeting for all
mentors, where you can share any issues or doubts you're having and get feedback or brainstorm
ideas with your colleagues. The directors also take part, so that they can hear about any recurring
problems mentors are facing and also provide their input and help.
