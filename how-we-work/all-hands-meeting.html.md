title: All Hands meeting
---
Every month, we hold a we hold an All Hands meeting. We use this session to provide useful
information to all team members, with the intent of increasing transparency on Nebulab's
direction, successes, failures and next challenges. The meeting covers sevaral topics:

- **Welcome.** we welcome new team members. Often, there is a presentation of new
  hires in front of the rest of team so everyone knows some information about them.
  Here we may also talk about people who have left the company, if that happens.
- **Strategy.** This topic covers the high-level decisions that we are doing to make
  Nebulab grow. We talk about new sales initiatives, our hiring process or how we
  are setting things up for personal and professional growth of individuals. We share
  such information with everyone both to be aligned and to receive any feedback about
  the direction in which we're going.
- **New projects.** We introduce new clients, talking about their business, their team,
  which team members are assigned to work with them and why we think the client is a good
  fit for us. If we have lost a client instead, we honestly share what didn't work with them.
- **Rotations.** We describe which team members have switched projects and what need they
  are fulfilling with their rotation.
- **Policy of the Month.** We are very proud of this playbook, it's our set of policies and
  every employee can refer to these pages when they have some doubts about how to behave.
  Anyway, it's unrealistic to expect that everyone recall all the playbook's content. This
  space is dedicated to remind a single policy we have in the playbook so we can jog our
  memory about that specific thing. The policy of the month is chosen by the meeting's
  organizers.
- **Playbook changes.** When policies change in our Playbook, there's no better way to
  talk about them with the rest of the team. This allows us to share why things have changed
  and how these differences will impact company life.
- **Q&A.** We also hold a questions and answers session at end of the meeting. The goal
  here is to give everyone the chance to ask questions about the company or the topics
  discussed during the meeting.

The agenda of these meetings is in Tadum, where we will also leave links to any useful resources
you can reference (such as any playbook pages that might have changed).

## Organizing an All Hands

All Hands events need some work from the meeting organizer both to prepare the meeting content and
to be sure everyone is aware of the meeting and what to expect from it. If you are in charge of
organizing the All Hands, simply follow these tips to make it a success!

### One day before the meeting

- **Prepare the agenda.** Prepare the agenda in Tadum, listing any topics that will be discussed
  during the event. This is important so everyone is allowed to take a look and ask for
  clarifications about topics or propose additional topics.
- **Notify the team.** Once the agenda is ready, send a message into the #all-hands Slack channel to
  let everyone know that the meeting will be tomorrow and that they can read the agenda in advance.

### The day of the meeting

- **Notify the team.** Send another message in the #all-hands Slack channel to let everyone know the
  meeting time. This message can be used to remind people of important things like why attendance
  (and being on time) are important, how to join the meeting and how to ask questions.

#### After the meeting

After the meeting the organizer needs to close the agenda on Tadum and add any topics to be
discussed in the next meeting.

### Pro-tip: Slack reminders

Organizers can use the following Slack reminders to remind them of any actions they need to take
to organize All Hands meetings:

- `/remind me to "Send Slack reminder for All Hands (meeting is tomorrow)" next Thursday 15pm every 4 weeks`
- `/remind me to "Send Slack reminder for All Hands (meeting is Today)" next Friday 10am every 4 weeks`
- `/remind me to "Close All Hands agenda" next Friday 17pm every 4 weeks`

Please note that these commands need to be run **no later than Thursday during the the week of the
meeting**.
