  Keeping distributed teammates in sync can be a challenge. All-hands meetings are a place for
  discussion and interaction. Learn more on how we structure them!

Every month, we hold an All Hands meeting. We use this session to provide useful
information to all team members to increase transparency on Nebulab's
direction, successes, failures, and next challenges. The meeting covers several topics:

- **Welcome.** we welcome new team members. Often, there is an introduction of new
  hires to the team, so everyone knows some information about them.
  Here we may also talk about people who have left the company if that happens.
- **Strategy.** This topic covers the high-level decisions that we are doing to make
  Nebulab grow. We talk about new sales initiatives, our hiring process, or how we
  are setting things up for personal and professional growth of individuals. We share
  such information with everyone both to be aligned and to receive any feedback about
  the direction in which we're going.
- **New projects.** We introduce new clients, talking about their business, their team,
  which team members are assigned to work with them, and why we think the client is a good
  fit for us. If we have lost a client instead, we honestly share what didn't work with them.
- **Rotations.** We describe which team members have switched projects and what need they
  are fulfilling with their rotation.
- **Policy of the Month.** We are very proud of this Playbook, it's our set of policies and
  every employee can refer to these pages when they have some doubts about how to behave.
  Anyway, it's unrealistic to expect that everyone recalls all the Playbook's content. This
  space reminds us about a single policy we have in the Playbook so we can jog our
  memory about that specific thing. The policy of the month is chosen by the meeting's
  organizers.
- **Playbook changes.** When policies change in our Playbook, there's no better way to
  talk about them with the rest of the team. This allows us to share why things have
  changed and how these differences will impact company life.
- **Q&A.** We also hold a questions and answers session at the end of the meeting. The goal
  here is to give everyone the chance to ask questions about the company or the topics
  discussed during the meeting.
