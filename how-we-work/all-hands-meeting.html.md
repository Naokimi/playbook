  Keeping distributed teammates in sync can be a challenge. All-hands meetings are a place for
  discussion and interaction. Learn more on how we structure them!

Every month, we hold an All Hands meeting. We use this session to provide useful
information to all team members, with the intent of increasing transparency on Nebulab's
direction, successes, failures and next challenges. The meeting covers sevaral topics:

- **Welcome.** we welcome new team members. Often, there is a presentation of new
  hires in front of the rest of team so everyone knows some information about them.
  Here we may also talk about people who have left the company, if that happens.
- **Strategy.** This topic covers the high-level decisions that we are doing to make
  Nebulab grow. We talk about new sales initiatives, our hiring process or how we
  are setting things up for personal and professional growth of individuals. We share
  such information with everyone both to be aligned and to receive any feedback about
  the direction in which we're going.
- **New projects.** We introduce new clients, talking about their business, their team,
  which team members are assigned to work with them and why we think the client is a good
  fit for us. If we have lost a client instead, we honestly share what didn't work with them.
- **Rotations.** We describe which team members have switched projects and what need they
  are fulfilling with their rotation.
- **Policy of the Month.** We are very proud of this playbook, it's our set of policies and
  every employee can refer to these pages when they have some doubts about how to behave.
  Anyway, it's unrealistic to expect that everyone recall all the playbook's content. This
  space is dedicated to remind a single policy we have in the playbook so we can jog our
  memory about that specific thing. The policy of the month is chosen by the meeting's
  organizers.
- **Playbook changes.** When policies change in our Playbook, there's no better way to
  talk about them with the rest of the team. This allows us to share why things have
  changed and how these differences will impact company life.
- **Q&A.** We also hold a questions and answers session at end of the meeting. The goal
  here is to give everyone the chance to ask questions about the company or the topics
  discussed during the meeting.

The agenda of these meetings is in Tadum, where we will also leave links to any useful resources
you can reference (such as any playbook pages that might have changed).

## Organizing an All Hands

All Hands events need some work from the meeting organizer both to prepare the meeting content and
to be sure everyone is aware of the meeting and what to expect from it. If you are in charge of
organizing the All Hands, simply follow these tips to make it a success!

- **Check the calendar event.** We have a shared Nebulab calendar that everyone joins during
  their onboarding. This calendar already contains all company-wide events. Just make sure
  the information in the calendar event is accurate.
- **Prepare the agenda.** Prepare the agenda in Tadum, listing any topics that will be discussed
  during the event. This is important so everyone is allowed to take a look and ask for
  clarifications about topics or propose additional topics.
- **Notify the team.** Once the agenda is ready, send a message into the #all-hands Slack channel to
  let everyone know when we'll have the meeting and that they can read the agenda in advance. It's
  also a good practice to remind people about the event a few hours before it starts. This is also
  a good moment to remind people of important things like why attending (and being on time) is important,
  how to join the meeting and how to ask questions.
- **Close the agenda.** Once the meeting is over, make sure to close the Tadum agenda. This way a new
  meeting agenda will be created and we can start populating it with topics to discuss in the next
  meeting.
