## Google Apps

We use the business version of the following Google services:

* email ([Gmail](https://mail.google.com));
* calendars ([Google Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/));
* contacts ([Google Contacts](https://www.google.com/contacts/));
* files ([Drive](https://drive.google.com)).

You can install and use these services locally on your Mac (after being provided with a @nebulab.it
account).

Of these services, pay specific attention to calendars and contacts, where you can find various
information about useful contacts (clients, freelancers, etc.) and appointments.

## Slack

We use Slack to chat and keep in touch with others. It is essential to communicate and understand
who is doing what at all times. The main account is <https://nebulab.slack.com/> and if you have a
@nebulab.it email address, you can sign up by yourself.

On Slack, it is possible to find some public rooms that can be freely accessed by anyone (their
names should be self-explanatory, such as `#development`) and private rooms that are usually used to
discuss individual projects and/or clients.

### Slack themes

* Nebulab light: `#F0F7FD,#EBEFF2,#FEF135,#222222,#FFFFFF,#222222,#5FBFFD,#5FBFFD`
* Nebulab dark: `#1D1D1D,#000000,#1373B1,#FFFFFF,#5FBFFD,#FFFFFF,#FEF135,#5FBFFD`

### Guidelines on using the chat

Working remotely with various offices brings numerous advantages, but there are also negative
aspects. Chat is, in every sense, one of the most important aggregation points we created to
maintain stability and compactness within the team. Below we have listed some points to follow when
using it:

* Say hi in `#general` when we arrive and depart.
* Use the chat for silly things as well.
* Don't worry about disturbing others, those who are busy won't read your messages.
* Avoid private chat as much as possible, especially for help or support requests. Others could
  have a better answer, learn from the question or may simply want to start a funny flame.
* Slack is our main communication channel and it is important that you can be contacted on it. That
  said, software development is a trade that requires long periods of concentration so, if you need
  to phase out, feel free to do so, making sure to advise your colleagues in advance.
* Remember that communication via chat is completely devoid of non-verbal signs, which make up 90%
  of human communication. Therefore, it is easy to misunderstand or be misunderstood by others.
  Emojis are an excellent tool for compensating the lack of context and emotion. Those that should
  be favored most are those that express basic emotions, since they are less complex. Another good
  option when chat communication becomes too complex is to organize a video call!
* If you're having a long discussion consider using threads instead of sending multiple messages
  to the same channel. This has the effect of notifying only the people you are talking to and not
  everyone else on the channel. Using Slack threads also makes thematic disccusions easier to follow.
  A useful tip for naming your thread: make it bold and use a funny emoji to describe it (i.e.
  **Thread Star Trek vs. Star Wars** ðŸ‘¾).
* Consider that Slack can be a huge distraction: for times when you want your teammembers' full
  attention schedule a call and skip Slack altogether. Scheduling a call makes the matter more
  important and gives everybody the chance to accomodate some proper discussion time. Google Calendar
  is your friend!

## Harvest

To track our work hours, we use [Harvest](https://nebulab.harvestapp.com/), which offers both a
[native app](https://www.getharvest.com/apps) and a Web-based version.

In order to get an idea of how to track time on Harvest, look at
[Measuring time](how-we-work/tracking-time).

## Dipendenti in Cloud

In order to keep track of vacations, leave, overtime and sick leave, we use
[Dipendenti in cloud](https://secure.dipendentincloud.it/app/dashboard).

You can track [time off](people-ops/paid-time-off-and-overtime)
by clicking to the [Presenze](https://secure.dipendentincloud.it/app/timesheet) tab and clicking on
a day (or dragging the mouse over several days).

You can request an expense reimbursement by adding your request in the
[Spese e Viaggi](https://secure.dipendentincloud.it/app/expenses) tab.

## Remote meetings

### Whereby

We use [Whereby](https://whereby.com/) for meetings with clients and other team members.

Whereby is based on the concept of rooms. Our main room is [/nebulab](https://appear.in/nebulab),
which you can use any time you want for work-related matters.

### SoapBox

We use [SoapBox](https://soapboxhq.com/) for managing the agenda, participants, notes and todos of
all our meetings. If you don't have an account yet, ask @mettiu to invite you!
