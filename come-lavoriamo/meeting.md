# Meeting

Communicating via Slack is our bread and butter, but sometimes a synchronous meeting  
is needed. Throughout the years we have built-up some best practices that help us make our
meetings as effective as possible.

## Organization of the meeting

- **Don't be afraid to say no.** We are all afraid of missing out on important things. However, 
  if you are invited to a meeting but you think that there is no reason for you to be there, don't be afraid 
  to ask what contribution could you make or what benefit could you get from it. If nobody can 
  answer you, it is probable that your presence is not required.

Moreover, if you are the organizer of the meeting:

- **Establish an agenda and the objectives.** Ensure that the agenda and the objectives of the meeting 
  are clear and everyone is familiar with them. If you are unable to set the agenda or the 
  objectives, ask yourself if a meeting is essential and if it would be productive.
- **Choose the participants carefully.** Do not invite people who cannot contribute or 
  benefit from the meeting. Everyone's time is precious and must be used wisely.
- **Create a shared document.** Create a Google document where all participants can 
  make notes. If you are organizing a recurrent meeting, divide the document by date.

## Before the meeting

- **Be on time.** Nobody likes wasting time. Do not start the meeting 5 minutes late because 
  you must start the computer. Ensure that you have 5-10 minutes before each meeting to 
  get organized. When it is time to introduce yourselves, introduce yourself at the meeting without asking others if they 
  are ready.
- **Come prepared.** Since each meeting must have an agenda and objectives, it should be
  easy to use the ten minutes of preparation time to think what you want to say. This practice helps you 
  structure your thoughts and saves all participants' time.

## During the meeting

- **Use a headset.** There is nothing worse than speaking without anyone understanding what you are 
  saying. Buy a good headset and use it for the meetings. DO NOT use a laptop microphone: even if it
  seems to work well, in reality it does not.
- **Start the webcam (if needed).** If others have access to the webcam, use yours too. Non-verbal
  communication is important and seeing the face of the person you are talking to helps
  build trust.
- **Take notes.** Taking notes at a meeting is an excellent way to stay focused, 
  and especially allows those who did not participate to know what was said 
  and decided. If you cannot take notes, make sure that _someone_ is doing that.

## After the meeting

- **Think about the meeting.** Take five minutes to reorganize the notes and reflect on 
  what has been discussed. If you have anything to add, send a message to participants.

In addition, if you are the organizer:

- **Record the actionable elements.** Write in the summary all actionable elements that 
  emerged during the discussion and who is in charge of each initiative, so that
  participants know what they are expected to do. (This also applies to initiatives, for which
  you are responsible.) 
- **Share a summary.** Share the summary from the meeting with other participants, so that 
  everyone can complete their notes.

If the meeting is a recurrent meeting organized by you:

- **Work on the agenda of the next meeting.** It is probable that at this point you would have a good
  idea of subjects to discuss and share at the next meeting. In this case, this is
  a good time to write them down.
