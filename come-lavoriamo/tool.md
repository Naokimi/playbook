## Google App

We use the "business" version of Google services to use and share:

* Email ([Gmail](https://mail.google.com))
* Calendars ([Google Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/))
* Contacts ([Google Contacts](https://www.google.com/contacts/))
* Files ([Drive](https://drive.google.com))

In order to make use of all these services (after being properly registered with a new 
account) you can follow [this procedure](http://support.apple.com/kb/PH14276) to install
all Google services locally on your Mac.

Of these services, pay specific attention to calendars and contacts, where you can find 
varying information shared with useful contacts (clients, freelancers, etc.) and appointment calendars, 
vacation and sick leave.

## Slack

To chat and keep in touch with others. It is essential to communicate and understand
who is doing what at all times. The main account is https://nebulab.slack.com/ and if you have an
email address on the nebulab.it domain, it is possible to access it choosing a password.

On Slack, it is possible to find some public rooms that can be freely accessed by anyone
(their names should be self-explanatory, such as `#nonsense-various`) and
private rooms that are usually used to discuss individual projects and/or clients, with which 
not everyone has to work.

In chat it is also possible to receive a lot of various automatic messages, informing you of various events
that take place. From the server status to account tweets
[@nebulab_it](https://twitter.com/nebulab_it) there are pearls of wisdom and information for
everyone.

### Guidelines on how to use the chat

Working remotely with various offices brings numerous advantages, but there are also negative aspects. Chat
is, in every sense, one of the most important aggregation points we created
to maintain stability and compactness within the team. Below we have listed some points to follow when
using it:

- Say hi in `#general` when we arrive and depart.
- Use the chat for silly things as well.
- Don't worry about disturbing others, those who are busy won't read it.
- Avoid private chat as much as possible, especially for help or support requests. Others
  could have a better answer, learn from the question or may simply want to 
  start a very funny flame.
- Slack is our main communication channel and it is important to is important that you can be contacted on it. That
  said, software development is a trade that requires long periods of concentration, so 
  if you need to 'phase out", feel free to do so, making sure to advise your colleagues
  in advance.
- Remember that communication via chat is completely devoid of non-verbal signs, which 
  constitute 90% of human communication. Therefore, it is easy to misunderstand or be misunderstood
  by others. The emoji are an excellent tool for compensating the absence of emotions. Those that should be 
  favored most are those that express basic emotions, since they are less complex. Another excellent
  option when communication becomes too complex is to organize a video conference!

## Harvest

To trace our working hours, we use [Harvest](https://nebulab.harvestapp.com/) that,
as well as the browser version, it also offers the [native app] (https://www.getharvest.com/apps)
for desktop and mobile.

In order to get an idea of how to track hours on Harvest, look at the section
[Measuring time](https://github.com/nebulab/playbook/blob/come-lavoriamo/consuntivazione.md).

## Employees in Cloud

In order to keep track of vacations, leave, overtime and sick leave, we use the software
[Employees in cloud](https://secure.dipendentincloud.it/app/dashboard).

Clicking on the tab [Presence](https://secure.dipendentincloud.it/app/timesheet) and then the
day or dragging the pointer over numerous days, it is possible to insert all the [kinds of
justifications](https://github.com/nebulab/playbook/blob/master/procedure/ferie-permessi-malattia.md)

This software also allows us to request a reimbursement for expenses, by inserting the request in the tab
[Expenses and Travel](https://secure.dipendentincloud.it/app/expenses).

## Remote meeting

### Appear.in

For meetings with clients and the rest of the team we use [Appear.in](https://appear.in/).

Appear.in is designed to work in _"rooms"_ and, with a paying account,
we have high-quality rooms and already reserved capacities. If you need to
book a room, ask at [@mtylty](https://github.com/mtylty).

The main room is [/nebulab](https://appear.in/nebulab), which you can use anytime you want
whatever your needs.
