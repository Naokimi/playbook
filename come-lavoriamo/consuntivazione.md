# Calculating time

In this section we want to provide a cue on how to correctly calculate working hours,
both spent on projects and hours in the office.

## The working hours

The effort on a project is established according to the number of hours, or simply days, 
of the week spent on a project. It is important to be aware of this and keep it in mind. If
you have any doubts on the number of hours to be spent on a project assigned to you, do not hesitate to
ask your mentor.

> If I skip a day of work on a client's project, do I have to [make up for it on Friday?](https://github.com/nebulab/playbook/blob/master/crescita-personale/venerdi.md#lavorare-sui-clienti-il-venerd%C3%AC)

Then the time actually spent on a project must be calculated. We use a time tracker for
various reasons:

- Honesty and transparency;
- Administrative efficiency;
- Ease of use;
- Data precision.

It is essential to keep in mind that the activity we perform is mainly creative. We do not set
objectives in terms of working hours and we always try to give priority to
work quality. The tracker is a simple instrument to keep track of the hours, not a
measure of our productivity.

However, we must be aware of the challenges brought by time tracking.

One of them is undoubtedly establishing which tasks need to be attributed to a project. There is no
single interpretation in our sector. However, in line with [our values](https://github.com/nebulab/playbook/blob/master/su-di-noi/valori.md)
we adopt the following solution:

- Time of direct service or implementation;
- Time of work in pairing on the project;
- Communication time directly related to the work performed;
- Study time directly related to the work performed;

On the other hand, the tracker should be switched to another project for:

- Time of direct service or implementation on other projects;
- Time of work in pairing with another person on other projects;
- Communication time not directly related to the work performed;
- Study time not directly related to the work performed.

> A particular case: Should I include the time spent waiting for client's responses, when I am
twiddling my thumbs? The answer is: never be in a situation where you have to twiddle your thumbs
and find something to do anyway. If you really have nothing to do, this time is NOT included in the 
"time actually spent", but the client should be informed promptly, reporting the
inefficiency.

There is no need to start the tracker for break times, but we leave the freedom, to those who want, to 
assign this time to the *Time wasting* project.

Some difficulties may arise especially when faced with having to deal with multiple activities
at the same time. We recommend you avoid multitasking. Focusing on
homogeneous tasks allows you to work under less stress with higher productivity and makes using 
the tracker much easier.

If you have any difficulties using the tracker, contact your mentor.

## Permitted leave or special leave hours

In order to calculate the hours spent at the office, just calculate the start and end time
of a working day, subtracting the lunch break time. This way you will know
if you worked the correct number of hours or if you have to [mark time off or special leave.] (https://github.com/nebulab/playbook/blob/master/come-lavoriamo/tool.md#dipendenti-in-cloud)

One very important rule of conduct is to always mark the hours of time off and
special leave day by day. Indeed, if you have to take time off during a working day, due to an emergency
or any other reason, that leave of absence,
short as it may be, must ALSO be recorded with a view to making up for that lost time
over the coming days. Constant and transparent marking of hours helps you not to forget, in the
specific case of time off, and being fair towards clients and colleagues.

Examples:

- *NO* "I take half an hour off today, without marking anything on Employees in Cloud;
- *YES* "I take half an hour off today, I will recover it tomorrow" marking a half a hour of time off today and half an hour of 
 overtime the next day.
