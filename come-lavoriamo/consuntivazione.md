# Tracking time

In this section we want to provide a cue on how to correctly calculate working hours, no matter 
whether they're spent on clients or internal projects.

## The working hours

The effort on a project is established as number of hours or days spent on a project each week. It 
is important to be aware of this and keep it in mind. If you have any doubts on the number of hours
to be spent on a project assigned to you, do not hesitate to ask your mentor.

Then the time actually spent on a project must be calculated. We use a time tracker for various 
reasons:

- honesty and transparency;
- administrative efficiency;
- ease of use;
- data precision.

It is essential to keep in mind that the activity we perform is mainly creative. We do not set
objectives in terms of working hours and we always try to give priority to work quality. The tracker 
is a simple instrument to keep track of time, not a measure of our productivity.

However, we must be aware of the challenges brought by time tracking.

One of them is undoubtedly establishing which tasks need to be attributed to a project. There is no
single interpretation in our industry. However we adopt the following solution, which is in line 
with [our values](https://github.com/nebulab/playbook/blob/master/su-di-noi/valori.md):

- time of direct service or implementation;
- time spent pairing on the project;
- communication time directly related to the work performed;
- study time directly related to the work performed.

On the other hand, the tracker should be switched to another project for:

- time of direct service or implementation on other projects;
- time spent pairing with another person on other projects;
- communication time not directly related to the work performed;
- study time not directly related to the work performed.

> A particular case: Should I include the time spent waiting for client's responses, when I am
> twiddling my thumbs? The answer is: never be in a situation where you have to twiddle your thumbs
> and find something to do anyway. If you really have nothing to do, this time is NOT included in the 
> "time actually spent", but the client should be informed promptly, reporting the inefficiency.

There is no need to start the tracker for break times, but we leave the freedom, to those who want, 
to assign this time to the *Time wasting* project.

Some difficulties may arise especially when faced with having to deal with multiple activities
at the same time. We recommend you avoid multitasking. Focusing on homogeneous tasks allows you to 
work under less stress with higher productivity and makes using the tracker much easier.

If you have any difficulties using the tracker, contact your mentor.

## Leave and overtime hours

In order to calculate the hours spent at the office, just calculate the start and end time of a 
working day, subtracting the lunch break time. This way you will know if you worked the correct 
number of hours or if you have to [mark leave or overtime hours.](https://github.com/nebulab/playbook/blob/master/come-lavoriamo/tool.md#dipendenti-in-cloud)

One very important rule of conduct is to always mark the hours of leave and overtime day by day. In 
fact, if you have to take time off during a working day, due to an emergency or any other reason, 
that leave of absence, short as it may be, you need to track it so that you remember to make up for 
the lost time over the coming days. Tracking your hours constantly and transparently helps you be 
fair towards clients and colleagues.

Examples:

- **NO**: "I take half an hour off today, I will make up for it tomorrow" without marking anything 
  on Dipendenti in Cloud;
- **YES**: "I take half an hour off today, I will make up for it tomorrow" marking a half a hour of 
  time off today and half an hour of overtime the next day.
