title: Becoming a mentor
---

Mentoring is an essential aspect of Nebulab: our focus on personal and professional growth is one of
the main reasons people decide to join us. In turn, this focus allows us to stay relevant and to
provide world-class consulting services to our clients. As you may imagine, being a mentor in 
Nebulab is kind of a big deal!

A mentor has many different responsibilities towards the company and their mentees, among them:

- Mentors ensure their mentees are always happy and growing, both as people and professionals.
- Mentors attend strategic meetings and help define company-wide policies and initiatives.
- Mentors act as informal project managers for clients, helping them to plan the work to do.
- Mentors lead by example, embodying the Nebulab values and culture.

With that said, being a mentor is as much of a privilege as it is a chore, and it also has its
downsides:
 
- Mentors do not get nearly as much time for technical work as individual contributors - 
  realistically, a mentor can expect to spend half their time writing code and the other half 
  managing projects and people.
- Similarly, mentors are rarely able to work on their own Friday projects, because their Fridays are
  usually eaten by 1:1s and other meetings and company-related initiatives.
- All this management work is not as visible as technical contributions, so if you're someone who
  needs a very tight feedback loop (i.e. you need to immediately see the results of your work), you
  might find mentoring to be frustrating.
- As a mentor, you are accountable for other people. At times, this can feel like you don't have as
  much control as you used to, because you won't be able to fix every issue by yourself anymore.

You should keep in mind that being a mentor is not the only way to advance in Nebulab: there is
always room for people to grow as individual contributors, and you shouldn't feel pressured to get
into mentoring just because you think it's the only option.

If you still want to become a mentor, with all the pros and cons that entails, read on!

## How mentoring works

The first step to become a mentor is to... talk to your mentor. :) They will help you figure out if
mentoring is for you, if you are ready and where to start. One thing to keep in mind is that we try
to have one mentor every 3/4 individual contributors, so there might not be space for new mentors
even though you are a good fit. If that's the case, just be patient and wait for the next hires!

As a mentor, you will be assigned up to 4 mentees and 3 projects that you will manage. Of course,
this will happen gradually, so that you have the time to get comfortable with your new role and
responsibilities. Usually, individual contributors who become mentors are assigned to the client
and team they are already working with, since it allows them to practice their mentoring skills in
an environment they already know.

You will still hold regular 1:1s with a member of the leadership team, who will follow your progress
and give you advice on how to up your mentoring game. Mentors need mentors too, after all!

## Running one-on-ones

The tricky thing about one-on-ones is there is no right way to do them: every mentor has their 
style, which means two one-on-ones can be different even when they're done in the same company. As a
mentor, you are encouraged to find your unique style and voice.

With that said, there are some ground rules to follow for holding effective one-on-ones (i.e.
one-one-ones where people say what they want to say rather than what the manager wants to hear):

- **It's about them, not you.** Even though the mentor schedules them, a one-on-one is about the
  mentee, not the mentor. Let them define the agenda or not have an agenda at all, and let them
  talk about whatever they want.
- **Be interested and show it.** Your main job during a one-on-one is to be genuinely interested in
  what the other person is saying, and to dig deeper and deeper until you are sure all the topics
  have been discussed exhaustively. 
- **Do not reschedule.** You should avoid rescheduling a one-on-one like the plague. Of course,
  we're humans and things happen, so if you absolutely need to, go ahead and reschedule the meeting
  as close as possible to the original date. 
- **Create accountability.** It is extremely important for every one-on-one where problems have been
  raised to create an action plan. Make sure both you and your mentee are accountable for that plan,
  and monitor its progress closely.

One more tip on scheduling the calls: when you have many mentees, it can be tempting to schedule all
of the one-on-ones on Friday, so that the rest of your week is free to do other work. However, as
these meetings are very demanding, it is hard to really focus on more than one or two in the same
day. Instead, try to spread them out throughout the week, so that you can give the same level of
attention to the same one-on-one.

## Giving feedback

One of your jobs as a mentor is to constantly provide feedback about your mentee's performance, both
about the work they do for clients and their interactions with other team members here at Nebulab.

While we all love giving out compliments and telling people what a good job they're doing, it's far
less fun to tell them when they're not doing so well. However, communicating constructive criticism
is the most important responsibility you have towards your mentees, the clients and the company, and
learning to do it well is essential for your success as a mentor.

Here's some advice, but keep in mind every person is different and responds to feedback differently,
so you should always adapt your communication style to the receiver:

- **Give feedback immediately.** When you see someone underperform, it can be tempting to wait for
  the next one-on-one to tell them, so that you can monitor the situation for a longer time and
  collect your thoughts. However, this can actually be damaging, because it allows the issue to
  become even larger. Learn to trust your gut and communicate feedback immediately, or after a short
  consideration.
- **Praise in public, criticize in private.** Most people are okay with and appreciate being praised
  in public, but criticizing someone in a public setting can actually make them feel like they are
  being shamed in front of everybody, so don't do that. When you need to provide negative feedback,
  do it in a DM or a private meeting.
- **Make it about growth.** Frame any negative feedback you have in the context of the person's
  growth path: remember we're all on a journey, and maybe this person is just a bit stuck in theirs.
  Accompany the feedback with practical steps the person can take to correct their behavior, and
  make it clear how this will make team a better team member. 

Most importantly: always keep in mind that **feedback is a two-way street.** When you criticize
someone, really listen to their response, because it might indicate that there is a larger problem
in the project or in the company. For instance, if an engineer is skipping most of a project's
standups, your first thought might be that they are not responsible enough. However, this might
actually be a sign that the standups are not structured properly and the person is skipping them so
they can focus more on writing code than attending a one-hour status report that doesn't add any
value to their work. As you can see, you should always be on the lookout for any external factors
that might cause a team member to struggle. 

## Promoting growth

Nebulab is all about growth: we want to grow as a company but, more importantly, we want to grow as
people and as professionals. This is why we only take on clients that we're excited about, and why
we invest so much time in the development of every single person in our company.

As a mentor, enabling and helping the continuous growth of your mentees is the most challenging, but
also the most rewarding responsibility you will have. It requires you to be constantly on top of
things and have a 360-degree vision of what the person is working on, how they are performing and
how they feel about it.

At its core, our framework for growth is quite simple, and it only consists of four steps:

1. Identify an area where the mentee wants to grow.
2. Assign them to projects that will enable their growth.
3. Monitor their progress and unblock them when needed.
4. Repeat.

However, this definitely sounds simpler than it is, so let's try to analyze these steps one by one.

### Finding areas for growth

First of all, you have to find the right areas for your mentee to grow. These can be discovered in
different ways:

- **Proposed by the mentee.** Very often, your mentee will propose something they are excited about
  and want to learn. This can be a new technology or maybe a different development workflow. Mentees
  should be granted a lot of freedom in what they can study on Fridays, but beware of exotic choices
  (we don't have any room for [Whitespace][whitespace] developers).
- **Proposed by the mentor.** The mentor should also ensure that the mentee is comfortable with the
  fundamentals of our daily work, which is especially important for junior developers: English,
  version control, test automation, good communication and priority management should be mastered by
  all team members.
- **Required for a project.** Sometimes, a project might also require a team member to learn
  something new. This is great, as it means the team member will be able to fully immerse themselves
  in the learning process and put their new skills to use immediately!

If both you and your mentee are out of ideas, perhaps you can take some inspiration from the latest
[demo Friday][demo-fridays] or take a look at what other people in the team are doing.

### Tackling the right project

In the real world, we all have a responsibility towards our clients to do our best work and to
always assign the right person to the right job, so you can't have a junior developer work on a
strategic, time-sensitive project just because it will help them grow.

This is why we have [Fridays][fridays], a safe space to learn and experiment with new tools,
technologies and workflows. These should be the first option when it comes to growth. Talk to your
mentee and find or create a project they are passionate about that will help them grow, then get to
work!

Another option is to find low-priority tasks in the client's backlog that will help the mentee
achieve their goals, but always monitor their work closely to ensure they're not causing any
disruption to the client, and be ready to terminate/pause the project if the client's priorities
change.

### Monitoring and unblocking

So you have something to learn and a project to help the mentee learn it. What now?

One-on-ones are good as a monthly touchpoint to see how the project is progressing and how your
mentee is feeling about it, but you should check on their progress much more often than that,
ideally every day that they spend working on their growth project: some people are reluctant to ask
for help, so it's extremely important that you are always on top of things and are able to offer
help proactively. You don't want your mentee to be stuck for an entire month on a minor issue and
only find out about it during the one-on-one!

Also, when you are helping them, make sure to explain and fix any issues together rather than doing
their homework. This is _their_ growth project, not yours. It may be tempting to save them time and
get straight to the solution, but you would be actually damaging them by not giving them all the
context they need to understand what is going on.

Finally, if you as the mentor get stuck on something, don't be afraid to ask for help yourself! You
can either ask another mentor or pair the mentee with a more senior team member. The point of being
a mentor is not to know it all, but rather to support their mentees in any possible way during their
journey and to set an example, and showing them that you're not afraid to admit when you need help
is the best example you can set.

## Managing projects

In addition to following the growth of their mentees, mentors are also assigned to client projects
where they act as informal project managers. Your main responsibility towards clients is to ensure
that the team embodies the [Nebulab values][values] in all interactions with the client.

It is important that you are proactive rather than reactive: do not wait for problems to arise on
the project before dealing with them, but rather use your experience and gut to tell when something
is not going well and deal with any issues before they even reach the client. Ideally, your work as
project manager should be invisible: you should allow the development team to shine without getting
in their way.

In doing so, always act as if you are spending your own money. Respect business priorities and never
spend development hours on tasks that will not bring value to the project. Of course, this does not
mean that there is no space for refactoring or under-the-hood improvements, as long as these are
changes that will improve the quality or stability of the product. When this is the case, make sure
to discuss these improvements with the client and explain why they are important so that they can
make the right decision.

Finally, a note on making decisions: as a project manager, you will sometimes call the shots on
technical (or even business) matters that the client delegates to you. For instance, you may find
yourself making build-vs-buy decisions, or deciding whether to use a new framework for that feature
or rely on a more boring, but proven, technology. You should listen and address any feedback from
the team, but at the end of the day, you must go with the option that _you_ feel is right, because
it's your job to make the right decisions based on your personal experience. To be able to do this,
you need to foster the kind of culture where people can [disagree and commit][disagree-and-commit].

## Handling conflict

When you interact with so many people, conflict is inevitable. What matters is the way you handle
conflict, how you are able to extract useful information from conflict and take corrective steps
based on that information.

No matter whether you are in conflict with a client or a team member, here are some tips that will
help you handle it in the best possible way:

- **Don't take it personally.** You represent Nebulab, not yourself. Even if the feedback you are
  receiving is directed at you, do not take it personally: you're in a professional setting and
  should act like a professional. Respond with facts and numbers rather than opinions and remarks.
- **Take your time to respond.** It can be hard to think when you're under enemy fire. It is
  perfectly acceptable, even during a call, to take some time to collect your thoughts and respond
  properly. Let the other person express all of their ideas, then take as long as you need to
  express yours. You may even do it in a different moment if you prefer.
- **Show empathy.** This is the golden rule: keep in mind that the other person has a right to be
  heard and have their feelings acknowledged. Never dismiss someone's feedback just because you
  think they're wrong and always take the time to respond properly.
- **Take action.** When no one does anything about it, conflict only gets worse and worse, until it
  explodes and becomes unmanageable. End every discussion with an actionable plan you and the other
  party commit to in order to make things right. This holds you both accountable and will show them
  that you truly care about what they're saying.
- **Learn to escalate.** If you're not sure how to handle a given situation or things have already
  gotten out of hand, you shouldn't bear this burden alone. Don't be afraid to reach out to someone
  from the leadership team to get help: that's why they're there!
