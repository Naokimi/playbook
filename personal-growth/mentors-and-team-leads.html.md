title: Mentors and team leads
meta_description: >
  At Nebulab, we have an unconventional management structure with mentors and team leads, with
  different responsibilities and tasks. Learn more about them in our Playbook!

Joining Nebulab can be a bit confusing if you come from a traditional company with only one layer of
management. If you read this playbook, you'll know that, at any given time, you will be reporting to
two managers at the company: your mentor and your team lead. While this may seem like an overly
complex structure, there is actually a very good reason for this separation of responsibilities, and
it has to do with your happiness at the company.

## Mentors work for you

Your mentor is in the business of people management, and they are responsible for _your_ success and
no one else's. They are the bridge between you and Nebulab, and will make sure that your time at the
company is amazing and rewarding.

They have many responsibilities, among them:

- Running regular 1:1s to make sure you are happy and productive.
- Making sure you are constantly growing as a person and a professional.
- Communicating feedback back and forth between you and higher management.
- Acting as your point of reference for any company-related questions.

Feel free to ping your mentor at any time with anything, that's what they're here for!

## Team leads work for... the team

Team leads, on the other hand, are _functional managers_. They are responsible for the success of
the client, the team and the project they are assigned to, and effectively act as project managers.

Here are a few of your team lead's responsibilities:

- Coordinating and prioritizing work on the project you are assigned to.
- Resolving any blockers that are preventing you from doing your work.
- Reviewing the work you do to ensure it aligns with the business goals.
- Creating and maintaining a relationship between the client and Nebulab.

Your team lead is your go-to person for anything that has to do with your day-to-day work.

## Team leads come and go, a mentor is forever

A big problem in most agencies is that people are constantly switching projects and, as a result,
they are constantly switching managers. This is a terrible experience: the relationship between a
manager and their team is one of the most valuable assets we can leverage to create a company of
happy, effective employees.

Separating mentors from team leads resolves the issue entirely. On one hand, it allows you to have a
stable point of reference at the company, your mentor, who will get to know you over many years of
work together. On the other, it allows clients to get the people they need to accomplish their
goals.
