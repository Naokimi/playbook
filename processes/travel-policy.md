# Travel policy

This travel policy defines travel and conference attendance guidelines for 2019. You can find
a [Traveler profile](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aW0GJGBOhCsYzHR2vgt-d5yh0bN5-cqg/) here -
this should be filled out by every team member in order to guarantee a hassle-free trip.

## Generic travel

The #travel Slack channel should be used for all travel-related requests such as hotel bookings, 
flight tickets and so on.

### Trains

We'll reserve first-class seats at the time preferred by the team member, if possible. There might
be fluctuations of 1 hour from the schedued time.

### Flights

Flight seat categories are the following:

- Italy/Europe: Economy
- Worldwide: Premium Economy (when possible, for flights over 6 hours)

### Car

We prefer to travel by public transport, but if you have to travel by car, the following policies 
apply:

- if you use your vehicle between main offices (Pescara/Latina - Latina/Pescara) there's a flat-rate
reimbursement of €150.00 per round-trip;
- if you use your car in Italy, we'll refer to the ViaMichelin cost estimation;
- total reimbursement for group B rental cars, including fuel and highway fees.

### Reimbursement for travel in Italy

We offer full reimbursement for the following expenses: train tickets, flight tickets, car rental,
bus tickets, hotel stay with breakfast and possible event ticket. Meals are on the Team member.
Moreover, we offer full reimbursement for Taxi/Bus rides from/to the train station, bus station or
airport to/from the hotel and for the journey hotel/venue/hotel.

### Reimbursement for international travel

We offer full reimbursement for the following expenses: train tickets, flight tickets, car rentals,
bus tickets, travel insurance, hotel stays and a daily refund of up to €60,00/day for meals and
possible event ticket.

We also fully reimburse any [Uber](https://github.com/nebulab/playbook/blob/master/processes/travel-policy.md#uber),
cab or public transport rides from/to your train station, bus station, airport, hotel or venue.

We do not reimburse hotel minibar consumptions, pay-per-view TV, or any fines for traffic
violations.

### Useful information

#### Passport

Considering the frequency of our trips abroad, we advise obtaining a passport as soon as you enter
the company, as release times can vary wildly depending on the time of the year.

#### Expense reports

To obtain a reimbursement, every team member has to submit a complete travel expense report,
attaching every expense receipt (for both meals and travel) within seven days of their return
date from the trip.

#### Uber

Use Uber if you need a quick, easy ride around the city.

Before your departure, check if Uber is available at your destination (you can do it from
[here](https://www.uber.com/it/cities/)). Also make sure you're part of the Nebulab Uber
organization (if you're not, ask for it in the #travel Slack channel).

All you have to do if you need a ride is book your Uber as usual and select "Nebulab Srls" from the
account selection menu.

#### Hotel invoices

At checkout, if you are the person in charge of the reservation, you need to ask for an invoice.
Here's our company information:

```
Nebulab srls

Strada Comunale Piana, 3
65129 Pescara (PE)
Italia

Partita IVA (VAT ID): IT02112180688
Codice fiscale (tax ID): IT02112180688

Electronic invoice code: M5UXCR1
```

#### Reservation notice

A three-month notice is required to attend non-European conferences/events.

A two-month notice is required to attend European/Italian conferences/events.

#### Travel documents

We'll send all booking confirmation and tickets by email.

If you're travelling by plane, make sure to check-in online 24-48 hours in advance and print your
boarding pass before departure.

#### Staying safe

Always watch your passport's expiration date. Make sure it expires in at least 6 months. Also ensure
you always have at least two blank pages for visas.  

You can find useful information for the country you are visiting on the [Farnesina](http://www.viaggiaresicuri.it/home.html)
website, such as any practices needed to enter the country (visa, vaccinations and so on).

#### Credit card

If you are travelling abroad, especially in the US, you will need a credit card to your name (which
is different from a debit card in that it has embossed numbers). Credit cards are required for car
rentals and hotel deposits, for instance. You can ask your bank if you don't have one, or get one
directly with [American Express](https://www.americanexpress.com/it/).

#### Travel insurance

When you travel outside of the European Union, we'll provide adquate medical insurance to cover any
possible injuries.

#### Useful mobile Apps

- **Wi-Fi Finder** detects free Wi-fi networks.
- **MetrO, Kinevia** is a free mobile guide to public transport systems worldwide. It provides the
fastest route to your point of interest considering the day of the week and the time of the day.
- **the official app of your airline** will often allow you to download an e-ticket for Apple 
Wallet or Pass2U Wallet. Also, it will provide handy information about your flight.
- **MyTaxi** is a taxi app available in 9 European countries (including Italy).
- **[Uber](#uber)**.

## Conferences

### Choosing the right conference

[This document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QX6YhV3GMPwE9sQ8x52wDhUzyhKRfXxG2jqAFrt3tsQ)
contains a list of interesting conferences:

- self-improvement conferences recommended for topics that are related to our work and business;
- marketing conferences, which are attractive for our marketing initiatives.

These are just suggestions: you can ask us to add other conferences to the document by pinging the
\#conferenze Slack channel.

Your mentor will help you choose which conferences to attend. Propose your conference schedule,
in accordance with our [yearly allowance](#yearly-budget-and-days-amount), and explain why you are
interested in those events.

Finally, make sure to [get the most out of your conferences.](https://github.com/nebulab/playbook/blob/master/personal-growth/conferences.md)

### Yearly budget and days amount

Every year, we publish a budget detailing the budget allowance and number of days you can use for
conference conference. The conference list contains the number of days and cost for each event.

For 2019, you can use up to **8 days** and **€3.400,00** for conferences.

### Strategic attendance

If you're in the conference marketing team, we won't deduct the conference from your yearly budget.

### Speaking to a conference

Being invited as a speaker is an honor and a great way to contribute to the community. It also gives
the company a lot of visibility.

Therefore, we encourage to submit talk proposals to any conferences you think are interesting, no
matter whether it's in the conference list or not.

If you're invited as a speaker, we won't deduct the conference from your yearly budget.

## Team retreats

We will organize one team retreat per year. Team retreats usually last one week and give us a chance
to get to know each other better, build trust and improve communication and cooperation.

They're also a lot of fun!

We'll inform everyone of team retreats at least three months in advance. Attendance is not 
mandatory, but strongly encouraged.
