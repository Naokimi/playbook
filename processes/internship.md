# Internship

At Nebulab, we strongly believe in a person's ability to reveal their potential under the right
conditions. This is why we created a permanent internship position within our team.

The internship aims to place developers who are just starting out in a real work environment, in
order to teach them the best practices in development and teamwork. With us, you will learn
everything you need to work on real projects with real clients and with all the responsibilities
that entails.

Our internship runs for four months. At the end of the internship, if everything goes well, we will
extend to become a permanent member of the Nebulab team. If this is not possible, we will help you 
find a position that best suits your needs.

## Process

### Basic requirements

First of all, make sure you meet the basic application requirements, which are:

- Excellent knowledge of Italian (because this is the language we speak here) and English (because 
  the majority of our clients are foreign);
- Sound knowledge of basic programming concepts (flow control, the most common iterative 
  structures) and of OOP programming (classes, objects and inheritance);
- A proactive approach to work and learning (i.e. do not wait for us to tell you what to do
  or what to read, but ask us or find it!).

We realize that these requirement could eliminate candidates who do not have experience in
programming but would like to learn. Unfortunately, at this stage, teaching programming would be an
excessive time investment for us. If you do not have programming experience, but would like to
learn, we suggest checking these resources:

- [Learn to Program (2nd edition)](https://pragprog.com/book/ltp2/learn-to-program)
- [Programming Ruby (2nd edition)](https://pragprog.com/book/ruby/programming-ruby)
- [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/)

### Selection process

The selection process is the same for everyone, interns or not, so check the page
[Hiring](https://github.com/nebulab/playbook/blob/master/processes/hiring.md).

## Onboarding

This is what we will do upon your arrival at Nebulab:

- We will create a @nebulab.it email for you;
- We will invite you to our Slack, Harvest and all the tools we use;
- We will assign you a [mentor](https://github.com/nebulab/playbook/blob/master/personal-growth/mentoring-and-1-1.md),
  who will assist you throughout your internship;
- We will assign a real project for you to work on;
- We will give you access to all the [benefits](https://github.com/nebulab/playbook/blob/master/personal-growth/benefits.md) 
  of the Nebulab team!

As you can see, the mentor is an important person in the internship. You will draw up a personal 
growth plan with your mentor, and together, you will see where you are now and where you want to be
at the end of the internship, and how to measure whether you are progressing in that direction. You
will also have bi-weekly one-on-one meetings with your mentor to assess how things are going.

## Working for clients

Now that you are in and have all the tools you need, it's time to start working! You will become
part of the project's team, so you will participate in meetings with the client and other team
members. Your mentor and the project team will provide you with tasks to complete. 

You will be assisted at each step of the process, but if you need help with anything, do not
hesitate to ask someone in a private message or, even better, in #development.

The code you write will be checked by your mentor and by a member of the project team with whom you
are working. They will advise you on how to improve what you have done and will recommend appropriate
resources to consult.  

We know that working for clients can be scary, if not terrifying, for someone who has never been in
a real work environment! Here are a few points that will reassure you:

- We have excellent relations with our clients, often built over years of working together. If we
  are still working with them, it is because they are fantastic people who share our values.
- If we have chosen you to work with us, this is because we think you can do it.
- Your mentor and the project team you have been assigned to help and support you with any doubts or
  problems you might have. Don't be afraid to ask for help!
- You are here to learn, so we expect (even hope) that you will make mistakes: this is the only real
  way to learn.
- We have processes (such as code reviews) to prevent any errors you make from affecting the client.
  Even if a mistake managed to get into production, it wouldn't be the end of the world.
- The client knows that you are an intern and has agreed to be a part of your internship.

Just remember the [values](https://github.com/nebulab/playbook/blob/master/about-us/our-values.md) that 
inspire us in our work and you will do a great job.

Happy coding!

## After the internship

At the end of the four-month internship, you will meet with your mentor to assess your progress. If
we are happy and think that Nebulab is the place for you, we will offer you the chance to become a
full-time member of the team as a junior developer. 

This is what will happen if you accept:

- You will probably be moved to another project, more suited to your new level of experience;;
- We will take you out for dinner to celebrate!

Once you have survived the dinner, the rest of the transition should be quite easy.

## FAQs

**Is the internship paid?**

Yes. You will have a salary that depends essentially on your starting level and your professional
status (freelance professional with VAT number, unemployed, etc.) that will be assessed on a case by
case basis.

**I am an expert programmer, but in another environment. Can I do the internship anyway?**

Our internship is meant for candidates just starting out in the world of programming, so people with
more experience would probably not feel at ease following the path we have established. That said,
if you want to work with us but you do not exactly match an intern's profile, please
[apply](https://nebulab.it/careers) anyway.  

**I already know that I do not want to work at Nebulab at the end of the internship. Can I apply?**

Unfortunately not. The internship represents a serious investment for us, and we cannot train people
who already know that they do not want to work with us. _But_ we do want to know why you don't think
that Nebulab is the right place for you, so do not hesitate to [write to us](https://nebulab.it/contact-us/).
Perhaps we can make you change your mind!
