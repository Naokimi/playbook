# Development environment

The setup phase is essential for passing from a virgin machine to a computer ready to work 
on Nebulab projects. Fundamental concepts:
  
* Use a Mac, preferably portable;
* Use [laptop](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop);
* Use [dotfiles](http://github.com/nebulab/dotfiles).

No one is obliged to use these tools, but we recommend being adaptable to others,
especially if you have chosen a technology that others have not adopted.
