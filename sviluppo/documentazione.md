## Readme

A good readme is fundamental for the project's health, because it permits new developers
to start working on the code quickly, without asking others how to configure 
the application or the development environment. Ideally, the readme should contain all of the following 
points:

- A short description of the project;
- How to install the project for local development;
- What guidelines have been adopted for the code;
- What is the work flow for development of new features;
- Which external tools are used (for example: SendGrid, Honeybadger);
- How does the project deployment work in various environments.

For inspiration regarding the readme structure and content you can look at some
existing projects or ask in #development.
