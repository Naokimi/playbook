title: Development environment
meta_description: >
  Our goal at Nebulab is to standardize the development process for our team members and our
  clients. Here's our typical development setup!
---

The setup phase is essential for passing from a virgin machine to a computer ready to work on 
Nebulab projects. Fundamental concepts:
  
* use a Mac, preferably a laptop;
* use [laptop](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop);
* use [dotfiles](http://github.com/nebulab/dotfiles).

No one is required to use these tools, but we recommend being adaptable to others, especially if you 
choose hardware or software that are not commonly adopted.
