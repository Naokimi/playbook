title: What we do
---

Over the years, we have specialized in the development of custom eCommerce websites with Ruby on
Rails and Solidus. As part of our eCommerce work, we provide the following services:

* Solidus migrations;
* Web application design;
* Ruby on Rails development;
* Vue.js/React development;
* creative front-end development.

At the moment, we do not work on projects outside of the eCommerce/Solidus space, as we believe
there is still a lot of space to provide value to this industry.

In the future, we may work on generic Rails projects and/or the design and development of mobile
applications.
