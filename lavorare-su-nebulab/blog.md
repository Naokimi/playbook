# Blog

Our marketing team is trusted with managing [our blog](https://nebulab.it/blog/), and they make 
sure that it is always updated.  
The Blog is our way of contributing to the OSS panorama, and a way of making ourselves known  
to potential clients and contributing to our SEO campaigns. Moreover, writing is also an excellent 
exercise in understanding and setting topics we are studying and clarifying the problems  
we are facing (for example, a Friday project could become a wonderful 
article!). We are all free to contribute to Nebulab's Blog.

However, as was mentioned above, it is important to keep the Blog updated, so if there are no  
volunteering authors, your mentor could encourage you to 
write.

## Writing a post

Writing a post is a process that involves six phases, and it is fully managed on a 
[GitHub project](https://github.com/nebulab/nebulab/projects/3):

1. **Proposal:** if you want to propose an article, open an issue and add it to the project backlog 
[Blogposts](https://github.com/nebulab/nebulab/projects/3) on GitHub. In the issue, include some 
details on what you would like to write about and how you would tackle this. On the other hand, if you don't have any ideas, 
you could choose one of the articles that has already been proposed by Shana or others, or 
consult with your mentor.
2. **Acceptance:** discuss the subject you decided to write about with your mentor and collect 
as many elements as possible for drafting the article. After obtaining mentor's approval, contact Shana 
and give her a general rundown about the idea and the objectives of your article. Shana will give you 
preliminary indications to be as SEO Friendly as possible in the drafting (if necessary) and will move the issue 
to the To Do list and will give you the final OK. At this point you can start working!
3. **Drafting:** write the article following [the guidelines](https://github.com/nebulab/nebulab/blob/master/source/blog/posts/2050-01-01-blogpost-template.html.markdown) 
in the repository. If you have any doubts or need help, write in #nebulab and someone will definitely 
be happy to lend you a helping hand.
4. **Feedback and Review:** ping on the #nebulab channel to ask for feedback regarding the content of your 
article and review it to correct any grammar errors or typos.
5. **SEO Review and Graphics:** after the article has been reviewed and the last corrections have been implemented, 
inform Shana who will make a review for SEO optimization of the article and who will in turn  
ping Davide for the creation of cover graphics.
6. **Approval:** the image and the last SEO touch-ups are implemented. At this point the article is 
ready to be merged and inserted in the social editorial calendar.

Please remember that you, as the article's author, remain responsible for it, so don't  
forget to follow the process until the end, even in the phases that do not concern you 
directly.

## Editorial calendar

A fundamental aspect of keeping a blog is to try to publish it at regular intervals, in order to 
generate content and present a serious image of the editorial process to the readers. We currently 
**try to publish an article every two weeks**, and any surplus articles are  
inserted in the calendar to be published at a future date.
