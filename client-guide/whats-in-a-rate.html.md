title: What's in a rate?

  One of our core values at Nebulab is transparency in all directions. This is why we are sharing
  how we calculate our rates in our Playbook!

There is a lot of literature criticizing the Time and Materials (T&M) approach to pricing, where
service providers are paid by the hour. The main argument against this kind of pricing structure is
that it forces your clients to pay for all of your inefficiencies. A lot of resources suggest going
with value-based pricing instead, where a client only pays you for the value you're providing to
their company.

However, value-based pricing is not really feasible for us, since all our contracts are long-term,
retainer-based projects, rather than only encompassing a single initiative/feature. Furthermore, we
are constantly working to make Nebulab more and more efficient, so we believe T&M to be a good
option in our case.

With that said, we also want to be fully transparent with our clients about how their money is being
spent and give them an idea of how our rates are calculated, which is why we have decided to publish
our cost structure for everyone to see and inspect.

## How we calculate our rates

We are not fully ready to share our final rates yet, but the cost structure below should give you an
idea of what goes into them.

| Item | Percentage of rate |
| ---- | ------------------ |
| Team salaries | 86.56% |
| [Management Scrum](/working-on-nebulab/management-scrum/) | 6.03% |
| Structural costs | 7.41% |

By adding up these costs, we calculate our _break-even rate_, which is what we need in order to keep
the company alive. Obviously, breaking even is not enough, so we charge a margin on top of the
break-even rate. This margin allows us to have a healthy cash flow, make new investments and have a
safety net in case of unforeseen events.

The margin we charge clients differs depending on the size of the team they hire:

| Team size | Margin |
| --------- | ------ |
| 1 | 20% |
| 2-4 | 14% |
| 5+ | 8% |

The reason we charge smaller clients more is that maintaining a small team costs us more than
maintaining a larger team. It also makes it easier for clients to scale up their team as needed.
