## What if I need 40 hours/week?

If you need 40 hours/week or more, you always have the option of adding a developer to your project.
In fact, we usually recommend at least two developers per project, so that they can discuss issues 
and solutions and provide feedback to each other.

With that said, many clients who initially thought they needed 5 full days of work per week were 
surprised to find out that 4 days were more than enough to maintain a good development velocity.

## What is your minimum engagement?

Our minimum engagement for a developer is 2 days/week with a strong preference for 4 days/week in
order to minimize context switching.

The ideal engagement (for both us and you) is at least 2 developers at 4 days/week, so that the 
developers can support each other and you always have a second opinion on any technical concerns. 

## What time is billable and what time is not?

We will bill you for any time spent actively working on your project. That includes development, 
testing, feature planning and meetings related to development work.

We will never bill you for sales-related meetings or other casual conversations around your project,
and we will certainly not bill you for any interruptions in our developers' 8-hour workday,
including lunch and other breaks.

## Do you provide team augmentation?

Yes! Many of our clients have their in-house development team whom we collaborate with, while others
outsource all their development needs to us. Whatever you need, we can handle it!

## How much involvement do you expect from me?

We ask clients to provide at least one person that will discuss priorities and requirements with our
team and provide information about your business concepts. We need your help to do our best work.
