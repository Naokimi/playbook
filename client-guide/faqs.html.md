#### What if I need 40 hours/week?

If you need 40 hours/week or more, you always have the option of adding a developer to your project.
In fact, we usually recommend at least two developers per project, so that they can discuss issues 
and solutions and provide feedback to each other.

With that said, many clients who initially thought they needed 5 full days of work per week were 
surprised to find out that 4 days were more than enough to maintain a good pace. Before you ask for 
another developer, we ask you to consider whether you need it (also keep in mind our minimum 
engagement policy).

Long story short: if you _really_ have the space and requirement for an additional person, we'll be 
very happy to provide one. Otherwise, we suggest sticking to the 4-day schedule for a while to see 
how it works for you. 

#### What is your minimum engagement?

Our minimum engagement for a developer is 2 days/week with a strong preference for 4 days/week in
order to maintain context switching to a minimum.

The ideal engagement (for both us and you) is at least 2 developers at 4 days/week, so that the 
developers can support each other and you always have a second opinion on any technical concerns. 

#### What time is billable and what time isn't?

We'll bill you for any time spent actively working on your project. That includes development, 
testing, feature planning and meetings related to development work.

We will never bill you for sales-related meetings or any other casual conversations around your
project and we will not bill you for any interruptions in our developers' 8-hour workday.

#### Do you provide team augmentation?

Yes! Many of our clients have their in-house development team whom we collaborate with, while others
outsource all their development needs to us. Whatever you need, we can handle it!

#### How much involvement do you expect from me?

We ask clients to provide at least one person that will discuss priorities and requirements with our
team and provide information about your business concepts. We need your help to do our best work.
