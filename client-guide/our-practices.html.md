title: Our practices
meta_description: >
  Over the years, we have established a set of principles that supercharge our development process.
  Read on to find what they are and how we implement them!
---

Over the years, we have worked with teams of all shapes and sizes. This has allowed us to distill
the aspects that make a team successful into a set of best practices, which we incorporate in our
day-to-day work and coach our clients on.

We want to make sure you understand and are on board with these practices, or at the very least open
to try them in your organization, and we guarantee the results will speak for themselves!

## Take ownership

Taking ownership, for us, means treating your project as if it were our own. A lot of agencies 
consider clients to be disposable, but we want to create long-lasting relationships with all of our
partners. We will work with you to understand your company's mission and culture, to ensure we are
aligned on all aspects of our day-to-day work together.

We take ownership by ensuring the projects we work on together are only considered done when they
start delivering value to your business, and working relentlessly until that happens. It also means
we will fight for what we believe in, when we see room for improvement.

## Keep it lean

We have witnessed first-hand how too much process and bureaucracy can slow a company down to a
crawl. We will work with you to identify and remove all the impediments that are having a negative
impact on the velocity of your team.

That does not mean we want chaos: we firmly believe in the importance of processes and workflows to
create predictable and scalable pipelines that give you and your developers peace of mind. With
that said, it is important that all processes exist to solve an actual pain point in your
organization, and not simply because they are an established practice.

## Be transparent

Transparency is important in a regular company, but it becomes paramount when you are working with a
development team on the other side of the globe. We are committed to providing our clients with all
the available information on our work, up to the point where they could easily replace us without
losing context. We will also provide continuous feedback on our relationship, to ensure it is
constantly improving.

We also expect you to provide all the information that can be useful to maximize the quality of our
work, and to be receptive to our feedback, even when it hurts a little.

## Go with simple

The tech landscape is constantly expanding, with new tools and practices coming out every day and
being touted as the next big thing. In this context, it is easy to become afraid of being left
behind and jump on the bandwagon, losing sight of whether we are actually solving the problem at
hand or creating new ones.

We take a different approach, adopting technologies and practices that have been battle-tested by
years of use and success. We are up to date on the latest developments in our field of work, but we
only go with exotic tools when the problem requires them.
