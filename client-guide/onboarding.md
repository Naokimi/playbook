title: Onboarding process
---

The onboarding process consists of six different steps:

1. **Kick-off call:** During this call we'll get to know each other. We'll introduce ourselves, our
   tools and our practices. We will also ask you to explain your project's goals and current work
   methodology (if any) and what you expect from us.
2. **Project evaluation:** After the kick-off call, we'll ask for access to any existing materials
   that might help us understand whether your project is a good fit for us. These might be 
   functional specifications, a project management tool, or your existing codebase. We're happy to
   sign an NDA if needed. We can provide
   [a sample NDA](/middleman/uploads/nda-draft.pdf) - if you
   need any adjustments to it just let us know.
3. **Negotiation and contract:** If we determine that we can provide value to your project, we'll
   send you an overview of the resources we expect will be needed to accomplish the required goals,
   along with their cost. If everything looks alright to you, we'll send you a contract to sign.
   [Here's a sample contract](/middleman/uploads/contract-draft.pdf).
4. **Tool onboarding:** Once the contract is signed, we will ask you to provide access to all the
   tools we will need to use to work on your project. Typically, these include your preferred
   communication tool (we prefer Slack, but other tools work too), your current project management 
   system (if you have one) and your version control system (we usually go with GitHub).  
5. **Team meeting:** At this point, we'll set up a meeting with your new team and ask you to bring
   any members of your team that will interact frequently with the developers. We'll get to know
   each other and make sure there aren't any blockers to starting the development. 
6. **Development kick-off:** Once we're all set, we'll start working on your project!

If you need to scale your team up, we will simply repeat steps 4-6.
