We aim to have this meeting quarterly. You will talk with our Team lead about our relationship.

## Goals

The main goals of this recurring event are to:

- understand if our relationship is strong;
- understand what's not going well in the collaboration;
- understand if you need any adjustments to the team (additional team members, particular skill
  sets, etc.) in the upcoming months.

## Template

You can use the following questions to understand the meeting content and to prepare for the
discussion:

- Are you generally satisfied with our collaboration?
- What kind of growth do you expect in the next quarter? What about the next year?
- Do you have a roadmap with the next things to do? Can you share it with us in order to understand
  if the current team can deliver everything in time or if it's under/over-staffed for what's coming
  next?
- Are all team members performing up to your expectations?
