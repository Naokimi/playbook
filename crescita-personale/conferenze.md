# Conferences

One of the employee benefits is the possibility of taking part
in any conference related to the technology sector, with reimbursement of costs for travel, lodging 
and obviously the conference attendance fee.

## Suggest a conference

In some cases, taking part in a conference will be suggested by a mentor on the Slack 
`#conferences` channel, but anyone can make a recommendation, so feel free to do so. Regardless
of the origin of the proposal, the process is always the same:

1. Someone suggests taking part in a conference at `#conferences`;
2. Those who want to take part, respond to the original message, explaining why 
   they want to participate and which talks they are they interested;
3. The mentors or someone on their behalf will manage the travel and lodging or, for conferences with only a few 
   participants, they can simply ask you to apply for a reimbursement of costs. 

If you are making the reservations and don't know the spending budget,  
please remember that there is no budget: use your common sense. We are not a Fortune 500 company, but we
don't want you to travel uncomfortably or be unable to sleep well. If in doubt, ask, and  
someone will give you an answer. 

## Get the most out of a conference

It is important to make a distinction between a conference and a team retreat: unlike the team retreat, the 
conference is an event focusing on learning, while the team retreat is an event focusing on 
having fun and socializing. While there is an element of socializing at any conference, 
it it important that the final objective of taking part, is personal growth. 

In order to get the most out of a conference, we do the following:

- If compatible with client requirements, we try to arrive the day before 
  the conference, to avoid losing a part of the first (and possible the only) days, and return only when
  the conference has finished. There is no problem if this means staying one day longer.
- We do not stay too long in the evening. Being out until 3 AM can be fun, 
  but stops being fun when the alarm rings at 7 AM.
- At the conference, we follow all the talks we want to follow, without being distracted. Sometimes,
  we don't like the talk and prefer to leave early, but if this happens
  repeatedly, perhaps we did not properly assess the conference when we decided to participate.
- We always show the utmost respect towards those making a presentation. It may seem easy to judge the speaker, but 
  it takes a lot of courage to stand on the podium in front of dozens or hundreds of people and  
  express one's ideas.

## After the conference

After the conference, it is a good practice to share what we saw/heard with others, together with
our impressions. It would also be fantastic to write an article about the conference! Here are some
points we could address:

- Was the conference worth it? If yes/no, then why?
- What were the most interesting talks?
- Have we learned things that could be applied to our work?

This information is priceless, because it could help others grow and decide whether 
to take part in the next conference!
