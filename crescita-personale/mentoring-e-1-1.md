# Mentoring and one-on-one

Upon your arrival at Nebulab, a mentor will be assigned to you. His/her duty is to follow you
throughout your working life here and ensure that you are constantly improving. Your mentor is your 
point of reference for anything concerning the Nebulab world, so feel free to
contact him/her at any time with any queries or concerns you may have.

One of the most important responsibilities of your mentor is the organization of one-on-one meetings. Each first
Friday of the month (if you are an intern, every other Friday), you will have a one-on-one meeting with your mentor
(a "one-on-one"). The one-on-one is not a standard style meeting: there is no agenda, nor is there a
set duration. If you wish, you can inform your mentor in advance about what you would like to discuss, 
but it is not essential. If you do not have anything specific to discuss, it will simply be a friendly chat.

Here are some things that the one-on-one is NOT:

- It is not necessarily an office meeting.  If you want to take a walk, tell this to your mentor. 
If you want to have a coffee, that's fine. If you want/have to do this from home, this works fine too.
- It is not an update on the status of projects you are working on. If there is any particular problem
you wish to discuss, feel free to do so, but your mentor will not exert any
pressure on you.
- It is not a meeting where you have to talk about work: if something good
has happened to you recently (or bad, let's hope not) and you would like to discuss this at the one-on-one, do so: these are the
most important conversations.
- It is not an obligatory meeting: if one day you simply don't feel like talking, please tell your 
mentor and compatibly establish another date. The one-on-one meetings are held regularly for
organizational purposes, but focus on people, not on schedules.

At the end of the one-on-one, your mentor will make some notes in a Google document that is then shared with you, on
what you discussed and your possible commitments, so that at the
following meeting you can review them and see how things have progressed.

The one-on-one is also a time to discuss your [personal growth projects](https://github.com/nebulab/playbook/blob/master/crescita-personale/venerdi.md)
and the goals you set for yourself for that month.
