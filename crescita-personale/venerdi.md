# Fridays

At Nebulab, Fridays are the time of personal and collective growth. On Fridays, we do not focus on
clients but on ourselves and, therefore, on Nebulab.

Every month, at the end of your 1:1 meeting with your mentor, you will decide what you wish to focus
on for the  following three Fridays: you can study a new tool that you found interesting, create 
a small app, contribute to an OSS project that you use often or work on a [post for the blog](https://github.com/nebulab/playbook/blob/master/lavorare-su-nebulab/blog.md).
Anything that improves your skills or Nebulab (or, even better, both) is fine.

Together with the project, your mentor will help you decide what objectives you want to meet and how
you can concretely show what you have done. For example, if you decided to study a new front-end
framework, you could create a small app with that framework. If you read a book, you could produce a
presentation on what you have learned. If you are not sure what to bring, your mentor will help you
choose.

Your Friday project will added to a Kanban board along with others, so that the team knows what you
are working on and are familiar with what you will be bringing to the [demo Friday](#demo-fridays).
If you have chosen to write a blog post as a project, remember to follow [our guidelines](https://github.com/nebulab/playbook/blob/master/lavorare-su-nebulab/blog.md)
and try to get it all the way to phase 4 (Feedback).

## The Friday Demo

The last Friday of the month is Demo Friday. We all get on a video call and everyone shows what they
worked on during the last month. There is no set duration for the presentation, but ideally it
should be between 15 and 30 minutes. After each presentation there are about 5 minutes for Q&A.

Demo Friadys are recorded and published privately on YouTube, in case anyone could not take part to
the meeting but still wants to see it.

## Doing client work on a Friday

In certain periods (e.g. the weeks leading to Black Friday and Cyber Monday), client work becomes
more important than usual. However, this does not mean that we must cancel our Friday investment
time to deal with last-minute requests.

That said, it is important to guarantee a minimum service-level to clients. So, one rule is
particularly important: if for any reason you could not work for the client on an agreed date, you
must give up your investment time for that week and make up for the lost hours.

This rule includes any kind of contingencies during the week, such as national holidays, vacation or
sick leave. The same applies to longer absences in the following or previous weeks, such as periods
of vacation, company retreat, conferences, etc.

As always, your initiative and your sensitivity play a decisive role. It is up to you to determine
if your Friday support is important for the client, for example, if you were absent for one or more
days while attending a conference. In that case, communicate this on #calendario and inform the
client that you will be available on that Friday.
