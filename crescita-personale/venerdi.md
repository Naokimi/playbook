# Friday

At Nebulab, Friday the time of personal and collective growth. On Fridays, we do not focus on
clients, but on ourselves and, therefore, on Nebulab.

Every month, at the end of your one-on-one meeting with your mentor, you will decide what you wish to focus on for the 
following three Fridays: you can study a new tool that you found interesting, create 
a small app, contribute to an OSS project that you use often or work on a [post for the blog](https://github.com/nebulab/playbook/blob/master/lavorare-su-nebulab/blog.md).
Anything that improves your skills or Nebulab (or, even better, both) is fine.

Together with the project, your mentor will help you decide what objectives you want to meet 
and how you can concretely show what you have done. For example, if you decided to study a
new front-end framework, you could create a small app with that framework. If you read a
book, you could produce a presentation on what you have learned. If you are not sure what to bring,
your mentor will help you choose.

Your Friday project will be put together with other projects on the board [Friday demo on GitHub](https://github.com/nebulab/nebulab/projects/5),
so that others know what you are working on and are familiar with what you will be bringing to the [Friday Demo](#il-demo-friday).
If you have chosen to write a blog post as a project, remember to follow [the posting guidelines]
(https://github.com/nebulab/playbook/blob/master/lavorare-su-nebulab/blog.md) and
remember that it would be best to have the post in phase 4 (Feedback) already completed.

## The Friday Demo

The last Friday of the month is Demo Friday. The Latina and Pescara offices will be connected via
video conference (those working remotely will connect separately), and everyone will show in turn 
what they did during the last month. There is no set duration for the presentation, but ideally it should be 
between 15 and 30 minutes. After making your presentation, wait for questions and make sure you have prepared
questions for other presentations!

The Friday Demos are recorded and they are published on YouTube, in case anyone
cannot take part.

## Doing client work on a Friday

There are times when work for a client is more important compared to
other times. However, this does not mean that we must cancel
our investment time scheduled for Fridays, to deal with a client's request.

That said, it is important to guarantee a minimal service for the client. So, one rule is
particularly important: if for any reason you could not work for the client
on the agreed date, you must give up the Friday of that week to
make up for that day.

This rule includes any kind of contingencies during the week, such as national holidays, vacation or
sick leave. The same applies to longer absences in the following or previous weeks, such as periods of 
vacation, company retreat, conferences, etc.

As always, your initiative and your sensitivity play a decisive role. It is up to you to determine if your
Friday support is important for the client, for example, if you were absent for one or more days
while attending a conference. In that case, communicate this on #calendar and inform the
client that you will be available on that Friday.
