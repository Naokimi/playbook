title: North stars

While [our vision](/about-us/our-vision) represents the destination, our North stars are how we get
there. They are the standards we hold ourselves to, the values we carry with us every day, and they
are what really defines Nebulab.

## Integrity

Integrity is doing and saying what's right, not what's convenient.

We all have an inner sense of fairness, and we should use that as a guiding light in our decisions
and interactions with partners and teammates. If something doesn't _feel_ right, it's probably not, 
and we should speak up.

Sometimes, integrity takes courage, such as when we need to provide constructive feedback to
someone we care about. This is good: it means there's a healthy tension between our sense of
integrity and our sense of empathy.

We should never forget that a lack of integrity is a lack of trust. In the absence of trust, it's
impossible to build shared vision, or get anything done as a team.

## Transparency

Transparency is systematically providing the context behind our choices.

Building a transparent company requires effort, empathy and respect. Most importantly, it requires
trust that people will use the information we are providing in good faith, and that they will speak
up if they disagree with our thought process.

Transparency empowers others to reach their own conclusions and make their own decisions. It makes
them feel like they're not just a means to an end, but rather the end in itself.

Effective remote cultures are, first and foremost, transparent cultures. 

## Intention

Intention is the _leitmotiv_ in everything we do.

We measure our words and actions by accounting for all the factors at play, and all the possible
outcomes. We take the time it needs to reach a decision, but no longer than that—most decisions can
be reverted, so we use our experience to make the best one and move on.

We don't let chance or external circumstances dictate how we work: we plan our space and time in
accordance with our values, goals and aspirations.

Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.

## Commitment

Commitment is caring about ourselves, the work we do, the partners we do it for and the community
we do it with.

We show commitment when we ensure everyone and everything around us is enriched as a result of our
presence. We do this by looking at the world with a critical, pragmatic eye, and finding ways to
improve the status quo.

There will always be something to improve—things we wish we had done, things we wish we had done
differently, and things we wish we had never done at all—and that's okay: showing commitment is
about the journey, not the destination.

Our first commitment should be to ourselves: our mastery and our physical and mental health.
Everything else will just fall in place.
