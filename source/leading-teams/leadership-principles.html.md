Managing people and teams is an art more than a science, but here are some principles we find useful
to practice in our day-to-day work:

* **Have clear priorities.** Your priorities should be, from most to least important: (1) the
  project; (2) the team; (3) the people that make the team; (4) you. These is a fine line between
  making compromising between these four priorities and sacrificing one for the others. Compromising
  is okay, especially in the short-term — burnout is not.
* **Stay human.** As a manager, it’s easy to get into a "superhero" mindset: you want to help
  others so much that you forget to ask for help. If you have too much on your plate or are
  struggling with something, talk it out with someone — ideally your mentor. We all need a hand
  from time to time. Superhero managers are a danger, not an asset.
* **Be glue.** Your most important job is to [act as glue](https://noidea.dog/glue) between the
  different parts of your team, and make sure everyone has all the information they need to do
  their job. Sometimes, this is just about communicating. Other times, it’s more complex (e.g.
  doing a PR review, holding a retrospective or a sprint planning).
* **Give feedback.** Engineering managers are in a very privileged position: they are managers, and yet they
  are very much hands-on. Because of this, you are able to provide 360-degree feedback to your team
  members about all aspects of their work. Remember to give feedback early and often and practice

  even and especially when it’s uncomfortable, and work with the mentors of your team members to
  enrich the information at their disposal and establish growth paths.
* **Manage risk.** This is easily one of the most valuable things you can do for Nebulab and the
  client. Because you have the high-level vision of the project, it’s easier for you than for
  others to foresee any risks in the client’s technology strategy and/or short-term initiatives.
  Set aside time to identify, communicate and mitigate risk.
* **Empathize with clients.** We act as if we were spending our money, not the client’s — it’s in
  our company values, so make sure to honor it. Always seek to understand the client’s point of view
  first rather than imposing your own. Keep in mind that our clients usually have a very good
  understanding of their problem domain(s), they’re just unsure about the solution.
* **Manage up and down.** You should manage both down (i.e. your team) and up (i.e. your client and
  the directors). Managing up and down is the only way to be truly effective as an engineering manager.
  Forget to manage down, and the team will underperform; forget to manage up, and the relationship between
  you and your client, or you and your manager, will deteriorate.
* **Seize opportunities.** You may run into a ton of opportunities to improve and consolidate your
  relationship with the client (team expansion, new initiatives, additional areas of responsibility
  where you or other team members can become an asset for the client) — get good at identifying
  them and seizing them, asking others for help when necessary. Be bold.
* **Foster ownership.** A manager’s most powerful weapon is fostering a sense of ownership in their
  team, so that they don’t have to delegate tasks because people naturally want to take care of
  things. Find ways to promote ownership within your team by creating an environment of
  [Mastery, Autonomy and Purpose](https://www.amazon.it/Drive-Surprising-Truth-Motivates-English-ebook/dp/B0033TI4BW).
* **Understand the business**. You cannot truly deliver value to the client unless you know how they
  make money. Take time to truly understand their business domain and the company’s business model.
  Research the industry, the competition, the most common causes of success and failure, and
  anything else that can help you and the team become better at what they do. Don’t be afraid to
  ask.
* **Promote Nebulab.** Make the client fall in love with Nebulab — not because it’s good for us, but
  because it’s good for them. Use any chance you have to mentor them about our values and our
  processes. Do fun things together. Celebrate the small and the big wins. Get to know the client,
  their team and their culture, and find ways to integrate it with Nebulab’s culture and vision.
* **Prioritize reflection.** Even though you’re technical, your role as engineering manager is highly
  strategic. How you handle a project can make or break our relationship with that client. Don’t
  just follow the rules, but deliberately set some time away to reflect on what you’re doing. Is
  there anything you could be doing that would improve the project?
