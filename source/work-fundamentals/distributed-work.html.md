title: Distributed work
---

Being remote is much different from being distributed: being remote is about _where_ you do the
work, while being distributed is about _how_ you do the work. You can be distributed without being
remote, but you can't be remote without being distributed. Too many organizations conflate these
terms and fail, because they don't realize that distributed work is an entirely different medium,
with its own rules, pros and cons.

Distributed work allows us to think more clearly, communicate more transparently, and work more
intentionally, not to mention the ability to hire people all over the world. On the downside, it
makes social interactions harder, and requires us to work twice as hard to bring people together.

Because we have two studios, Nebulab has been distributed since day 1. While some companies consider
remote work to be a benefit on top of co-located work, we've always considered co-located work to be
a nice benefit on top of our distributed culture. The studios are there if you're close by and need
a cool, quiet space away from home, but not in the slightest a requirement for doing your job.

At Nebulab, you should be able to open your laptop and get things done with no friction or loss of
context, no matter where you are. In fact, we transitioned to full-remote work during COVID-19
with no hiccups or policy changes, and the majority of the company nowadays works remotely.

What follows is a set of principles, rituals and tools that maximize the pros and minimize the cons
of distributed work, collected over years of trial and error.

## Default to public, written communication

This is rule #1. Whatever you do, it should be written and public by default. This allows
everyone to access it, and to do so when they actually have time.

This includes communication with colleagues, project briefs, feedback requests and any other piece
of information you want to share with or request from another human being, be it a peer, a manager
or a partner.

Communication should only be private if it's sensitive in nature, or if it might hurt someone's
feelings (such as when you're providing constructive feedback).

Communication should only be synchronous when you need to quickly bounce ideas off the other person,
or if you want to make sure no emotional context gets lost in translation.

## Define clear boundaries for work

For families and friends, it can sometimes be hard to understand that remote work _is still work._
People tend to jump in for a quick chat or a coffee.

Taking a break every now and then is healthy and encouraged, and one of the benefits of working from
home is being able to spend more time with the ones we care about, but this shouldn't happen at the
expense of productivity.

When you're at work, set clear expectations with your loved ones that you can't be disturbed,
and make sure they know when you're up for a break.

If you have the opportunity, it's very helpful to set up a dedicated workspace (e.g., in a separate
room). This helps you minimize distractions and really disconnect at the end of the day, rather than
bringing work around the house with you.

## Make room for the small things

When working in a distributed setting, it's easier to "get in the zone" and forget about everything
else. While this is great for productivity, it's not ideal for your social life. The largest benefit
of co-located work are the hallway conversations and casual chats that you have with colleagues.

We have some [company-wide rituals](/company-rituals/) to bring people together, but you should
still make space for those casual interactions that happen every now and then, like in the dead
times before or after a meeting. Don't be afraid to bring your whole self to workâ€”we're a friendly
bunch and you won't regret it!

After all, if we're not having fun, why are we even doing all of this?!
