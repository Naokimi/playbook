title: Compensation
---

We hire people in different regions and countries. Every market is different, and it can be
challenging to be competitive and fair in making an offer for the same role but in a different
region. The best way to deal with this is by localizing compensation to the local market.

### Why we pay local salaries

The reasons why we value this policy as a critical success factor, both in hiring talented people
and being fair and profitable as a company, are:

- having a strict salary structure will bring low competitiveness in high salary regions – this
mainly means that we can't hire people in that area;
- having a strict salary structure will bring high competitiveness in low salary regions – this will
bring a geographical concentration of team members, instead of a distributed team which represents
our main goal. Besides, we don’t want unhappy employees keeping their job at Nebulab simply because
they have a competitive salary;
- it's fair for anyone having the same relative wage for the same role – team members are treated
equally by the company, which brings a sense of fairness to the team.

## Relocation

What if someone relocates (for the long-term) outside their current area? We go through the 
[Offer step](https://playbook.nebulab.com/people-ops/hiring/#offer) once again to define a new
salary localized to the new location.
