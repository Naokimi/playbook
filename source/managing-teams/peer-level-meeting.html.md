title: Peer-level meeting
---

Each team has its own story and challenges. In order to share problems, find solutions together, and
prevent silos, EMs periodically chat in a peer-level meeting.

## The Engineering Managers team

While life as an engineer is deeply rooted in getting feedback from your peers, an Engineering
Manager may sometimes feel lonely.

The peer-level meeting acts as a support group in which you can share your management problems and
gather feedback on the solutions you're planning to employ. In such a setting, any recurring
solutions or problems also have a chance of being recognized as a pattern and addressed at a company
level.

The peer-level meeting also increases your sense of belonging to the "Engineering Managers" team,
allowing you to get to know the other EMs better, both personally and professionally.

## Meeting structure

The meeting usually lasts in the 30 minutes-1 hour range and is held weekly. The agenda is not
fixed, and anyone can bring up a topic. Common discussion points usually include:

- a call for help with a challenge currently faced by a specific team;
- a discussion on how other teams are approaching a particular problem;
- brainstorming on how to improve a process or which tools to adopt.

A journal is then updated by one of the attendees reporting the date, participants, and the main
topics or solutions that were discussed.
