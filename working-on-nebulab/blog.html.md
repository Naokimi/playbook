Everyone is free to contribute to our blog, which is run and managed by our marketing team.

The blog is our way of contributing to the software industry as well as a way of making ourselves
known to potential clients. Moreover, writing is also an excellent way to deeply understand topics
we are studying and to have clarity on problems we are facing (for example, Friday time projects
make for excellent articles!).

If you want to write an article, but you're struggling to find the right inspiration or idea, note
that we have a #blog channel in our Slack that you can and should join if you're working on or
plan to work on the blog. It's a fantastic place to get some feedback, suggestions, tips, or just
the occasional confidence boost! You can also talk to your mentor, of course. Anyway, even if you
don't master the "art" of writing blog posts (or, at least, not yet!) give it a shot. It can be
challenging, but it is definitely gratifying! And as we said, you can always count on the team for
help.

If you have a blog post idea, but you can't write it yourself because you don't have the time, just
put it up on the #blog channel and create a note in the Backlog column of the Blogposts GitHub
project. Maybe there's someone else who can bring your idea to life.

## Writing & Publishing Process

You don't need approval to write a blog post, just follow these simple steps. 

1. Open a PR using the dedicated blogpost template and add it to the Blog project's backlog on
   GitHub. The template is filled with all the instructions you need to take your blogpost from
   idea to publication.
2. Write the article following the [guidelines][template] in the repository. If you feel you need
   some help to get over writer's block, reach out to your teammates using the #blog channel on
   Slack and someone will be happy to give you some advice.
3. When a draft of your post is ready, ping your teammates on the #blog channel to request feedback
   on the content you created and review it to correct any errors and typos.
4. After the article has been reviewed (you need at least 2 reviews) and adjusted, ping @shana.remigio
   in the #blog channel. She runs the blog and provides a final review to ensure the article is in line 
   with our SEO strategy. She will also ask our designers to whip up an artsy cover.
5. Once the cover image and the latest SEO refinements have been implemented, your blog post is
   ready to be merged and scheduled for publication. Shana will communicate the date your article
   will come out.

Remember that you, the author of the article, are responsible for the entire publication process, so 
don't forget to follow your post's progress until its publication, even in phases that do not 
concern you directly.

## Guidelines for writing

Here are some tips for writing good articles:

- **Keep it short.** The ideal article is 400-600 words long. Longer articles are beautiful but they 
  are time and effort intensive - they should be the exception, not the rule.
- **Stay practical.** There's no need to overdo it and get philosophical. Write about an issue you 
  have faced recently or a new tool you're experimenting with. If it helps others, it's fair game.
- **Get it done.** It's easy to obsess over small details if you're not used to writing. Even if you
  hate what you wrote, finish it and get someone to review it.
- More tips can be found in our [article template][template].

If you follow these rules, you should be able to produce an article in 8 hours. If it's taking
longer than 8 hours, you should probably reach out to your mentor, who will help you figure out any
issues you might be having!

## Publishing frequency

A fundamental aspect of maintaining the blog is to ensure new content is published on a regular
basis. We currently try to publish an article every two weeks and any surplus articles are queued.
